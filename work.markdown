[Approximation Algorithms in Network Design]()
:   Linear Programming has been very powerful in obtaining good approximation algorithms for problems arising in network design. In this project, we study the modeling of these problems as integer programs. We survey the application of the primal dual method towards obtaining efficient approximation algorithms for the following NP-hard problems: Facility Location, Generalized Steiner tree, Prize Collecting Steiner Tree, Single-Sink Rent-or-Buy and Connected Facility Location. We devise a new primal dual algorithm for the Single-Sink Rent-or-Buy problem using a natural integer program. We identify the pathological cases where the algorithm fails. Elementary results about the working of the algorithm and the structure of the optimal solution are proved. We also investigate whether there is a scope of improvement in the 4.55 approximation algorithm by Swamy and Kumar. In doing this, we prove a lower bound of 3 on its performance guarantee.

[Congestion Based Financial Instruments for the Internet Economy]() 

:   Could market mechanisms be employed to tackle or relieve Internet congestion? In particular, we look at three market mechanisms: consumer- side congestion pricing, content-side paid prioritization, and bilateral risk sharing agree- ments. While the former two have been heavily studied in economic literature, the risk sharing approach towards congestion is a novel addition of this thesis. We treat the un- certainty in broadband congestion levels as an economic risk that consumers and Inter- net businesses are forced to bear. The thesis investigates the possibility of introducing congestion-based financial instruments, similar to derivatives in a stock market, that efficiently allocate risk borne out of congestion.

[Greed and Altruism: Observations through the lens of Behavioral Economics]()
:   We investigate departures from Von-Neumann-Morgenstern rationality in human behavior in certain economic transactions, and explained them in light of the recent literature in Behavioral Economics. We claim that the human altruistic instinct leads to violations of transitivity and independence assumptions, and devise experiments to demonstrate it. We also hypothesize that the psychological value of money depends on ownership, and devise experiments to test it.

[Man and Machine: Questions of Risk, Trust and Accountability in Today's AI Technology]()
:   Artificial Intelligence began as a field probing some of the most fundamental questions of science - the nature of intelligence and the design of intelligent artifacts. But it has grown into a discipline that is deeply entwined with commerce and society. Today's AI technology, such as expert systems and intelligent assistants, pose some difficult questions of risk, trust and accountability. In this paper, we present these concerns, examining them in the context of historical developments that have shaped the nature and direction of AI research. We also suggest the exploration and further development of two paradigms, human intelligence-machine cooperation, and a sociological view of intelligence, which might help address some of these concerns.

[Changing Dimensions: A look at Euclidean Spaces]()
:   A vector space over a field $$\mathbb{F}$$ is a set $$V$$$ together with two binary operations, called vector addition and scalar multiplication. It is standard practice to think of a Euclidean space $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ as an $$n$$-dimensional real coordinate space i.e. the space of all $$n$$-tuples of real numbers $$R^n$$, with vector operations defined using real addition and multiplication coordinate-wise. A natural question which arises is if it is possible to redefine vector operations on the space in such a way that it acquires some other dimension, say $$k$$ (over the same field, i.e., $$\mathbb{R}$$). In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative, for all $$k\in\mathbb{N}$$. We achieve the required dimension by `dragging' the structure of a standard $$k$$-dimensional Euclidean space $$\mathbb{R}^k$$ on the $n$-tuple of real numbers $$R^n$$. At the heart of the argument is Cantor's counterintuitive result that $$\mathbb{R}$$ is numerically equivalent to $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ for all $$n\in\mathbb{N}$$, which can be proved through an elegant construction. Finally, we generalize the result to all finite dimensional vector spaces.

<!-- [Financial Theory and Functional Analysis]()
:   We study how concepts from measure theory can be used to capture information flow in financial markets. We show that the existence of the conditional expectation of a given random variable follows from the structure of \mathcal{L}_2 Hilbert Spaces. Interpreted this way, the conditional expectation is the orthogonal projection of the random variable on a sub − σ – algebra - the unique a.e best approximation of the random variable on the closed subspace of the space of all random variables with finite variance.
