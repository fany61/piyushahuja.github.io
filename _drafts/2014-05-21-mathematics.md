Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.
— Jules Henri Poincare (cf. Poetry is the art of giving different names to the same thing)
A mathematician who is not also something of a poet will never be a complete mathematician.
— Karl Weierstrass
Such is the advantage of a well constructed language that its simplified notation often becomes the source of profound theories.
— Pierre-Simon Laplace (source)

Imagine a parallel universe, a very simplistic one,  where a civilization is on the cusp of enlightenment. People are making observations of the world around them, taking notes, springing up hypotheses, recording more observations and so on. They notice that there are in total 32 distinct individuals in their world, and though sometimes a few die and some are resurrected, that number never increases. They discover 

these individuals can be categorised into two symmetric types - which they call black and white. Thhey discover more rules: each type kills the other type, the motion of different individuals are restricted and follow certain patterns, that each individual occupies what can be called a square, that their world is a grid-like space having 64 such squares, and so on. They give specific names to each categorisation of individual  - knights, bishops, queens, kings, pawns, rook, to patterns - castling, checkmate etc, and so on. Till a point come where there is no further categorisation or rule left - they've recorded them all and given them names.

This limited vocabulary, along with the set of rules which apply on them, helps the civilization come up with all kinds of scenarios - about possible movements, pairings, combinations and states of the world. The vocabulary and the rules that govern them is extraordinarily effective in making future predictions as well as in improving the well being of your community, e.g., by preventing the death of your fellow type. The vocabulary gradually evolves to include more complex terms on top of the basic ones, allowing them to make more complex pattern predictions. The vocabulary and the rules that govern them are inextricably linked to the world, and it's use for communication doesn't even come in the picture.     

Such I believe is the nature of mathematics.

It has been characterized as a language, an art, a science, a tool. These characterizations are further linked with the age-old question: Is Mathematics [invented or discovered](http://www.quora.com/Philosophy-of-Mathematics/Was-mathematics-invented-or-discovered-1)



Mathematics as concretization and investigation of metaphors, their relationships and their efficacy. 



Mathematicians often pride themselves on the unique qualities of mathematical language - it's unambiguity, it's brevity, it's rigid adherence to logic, and it's [powerful applicability](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html), especially to the physical sciences. 
Galileo went so far so as to designate it the language in which the book of nature is written.[^einstein]

[^einstein]: Einstein had remarked, "How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?"

But why only natural sciences? Why can't we unleash mathematics in the social sciences, say in psychology, political science or archaelogy? What about the arts - paintings, music or scultptures? If mathematics is the language designate of nature, wouldn't the study of it in essential human-centric fields throw light on our relationship with nature? If we can call nature our reverend mother without sounding preposterous, can we also call mathematics our mother-tongue with the same credibility?

Indeed, the study of social sciences is becoming more and more quantititative. Economic theories are formulated and proved using mathematics. Game theory attempts to model the outcome of human strategic behavior. There are paintings of Escher, Penrose tiles and fractal art. Geometry, ratios and proportion are central to architecture. There are mathematical patterns in notes and musical compositions. And so on.

Yet invoking a mathematical device in an argument on moral philosophy, or as a defence for a political position, would seem ridiculous. 



Intesting position: Invetion and Discovery are vague concepts.

Discovering Morning Star = Evening Star



Important examples : Imaginary numbers, negative numbers, Riemannian Geometry


Collection of interesting quotes:

“The abstract realm in which a mathematician works is by dint of prolonged intimacy more concrete to him than the chair he happens to sit on,” says Ulf Persson of Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, a self-described Platonist.
