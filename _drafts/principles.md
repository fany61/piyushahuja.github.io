A friend once remarked that it would have been nice if there were axioms of life - things which held true no matter what, much like axioms of mathematics. I reflected on it a bit - axioms of life do exist - infact, entire different axiomatic systems for life exist (much like mathematics). We call them religion.[^example][^religions]

I am not religious. Instead, I prefer to have my own *guidelines* or *principles* or *things-to-keep-in-mind*. They are lessons I have learnt by watching myself fail multiple times. In a sense, it's my own personal religion, customised for my own pscyhological and behavioral aspects.

#### Skepticism

It is amazing that even after centuries of documenting and experiment what works and what doesn't, there's so much we don't know (about how to live life). People comment on the secrets of success, yet don't know how to *be* successful. There are whole articles written on the characteristics of a good leader, yet no one knows how to *become* one. And I'm not even talking about intution, creativity and so on.

Let me clarify. When it comes to the physical, it seems we have already tamed it. We know, to a reasonable degree, the limitations of our body - how high we can jump, how fast we can run, how far we can see, how much weight can we lift and so on. We know what must be done to improve these features and what is the maximum one can possibly hope to achieve. We know how to become good athletes with a good body - which excercise works which muscle part, what nutrition is needed to enhance which functionality, and so on.

But when it comes to the psychological, there are no inherent limits - the possibilities seem endless. There's no reason why someone can't become a good writer, painter, artist, leader, at any age or stage, with nothing but a little change in mindset and practice. The mind seems infinitely flexible - all you need is train it, and one can train in anything. There's no visible limit to the things your mind can achieve. 

One might tell you that just because you've never scored an A in your English class, or havn't read a novel in your life, or never poured down your feelings on paper, that you can't ever write a good poem. 

But what if I were to tell you that's not how it works? What if all that is needed for to produce a good poem is an outburst of emotions and a pen in hand? And maybe you don't even need an outburst, maybe all you need is a delicate translation of your sentiments from the domain of feeling to language, and anyone can do that with the right psychological pathway.
Maybe you do need to train yourself and write a few bad poems before you write a good one. But while there's some truth in someone tellig a bald man tht he cant get his hair back or an aged man that he cant get rid of his wrinkles, on there's no one who can say that you cant train yourself to become a writer or programmer or artist.

Who says success has to be incremental[^eg] - or what is the right mix. Maybe all the events in your life, all the habits you have and all the things you have done,  are brewing into just the ight potent mixture, maybe they have all lining up in just the perfect way that one day you'll, by luck or a spontaneous outburst of creativity or both, produce something extraordinary? 

Who says the secret of success lies in following your passion? Maybe following comes first and whatever you follow is termed passion? Maybe success lies in having a flexible passion, and bending it to suit the needs of the hour. Maybe you need to undergo painful tasks you hate as rites of passage.

Nothing is difficult in itself, only unfamiliar.

#### Machiavellian Notes

 For a leader, it is essential that he always maintains an aura of infinite depth. To show your own boundaries pins down exactly what you are - leaving little to the imagination. It humanizes you to the point that people think you are one of them in ability as well - and then look down on you - which does not bode well for you to lead. People want to be led by someone who they perceive to be better than them in a black-box sort of way. Being opaque gives the impression of a black-box - you never know what it has the potential of producing, and to what depths your talent extends has a reasonable degree of ambiguity about it. 

 In the same spirit, never repeat a joke. Never repeat emphasize a thought. Not only does it leave the impression that you're rather limited in your ideas, but it also disincentivizes thinking about new ones.

Decisiveness: Don't retype, don't correct, don't care. You’re always right, even when you’re wrong.

Call out bullshit when you see it. For errors, apologies can be delivered later

It is not about actions. It is about how you conduct actions. Stength and character come from the *way* you conduct yourself, not through whether you conduct yourself at all or not. So make that phone call when it's needed. Follow-up. Ask if the other person is alright. Apologize. Ask for that job. Show that you're serious in the interview. These actions in themeselves don't mean anything. Your demeanour and behavioral response would show that. Dont be "I’m a deserving guy – my work speaks for itself. I don’t need to be a salesperson " Be a salesperson. But a serious one. Any only sell things you actually have. It's all in context, body language and substance.
.

Perceptions of work are often different and sometimes more important than actuality. (Case in point - Singapore, QC, CGPA, MTP) . Sense of Value is different from actual value.

Smile judiciously.

#### Self-Improvement and Creativity

 Keep the power of incremental effort and network effects in mind. While the big award seems miles away and no amount of effort can take you there, making a small effort might lead to a small reward which in turn might set off a series of events which leads to the big reward. 

 Don't be afraid of doing the ordinary, saying the conventional when it must be said or done. Differentiate between contrarianism and constructive skepticism. 

 Modify your environment in such a way that the path you want to follow becomes the most convenient path. We habitually do not follow optimal path, but the path of least resistance. So a good idea is to change the resistance in such a way that they become the same - to change the rules of the game. For example, surround yourself with people you want to become. Change the default home page of your computer. Don't buy junk food. Espouse minimalism.

 Keep the importance of framing and metaphors in mind. One can frame the Aam Aadmi Party as a startup, as a political party, or a philosophical club. You can be agony aunt, a grandma willow, or a consultant. Framing can also foster creativity - find new metaphors and things start becoming interesting.


When undertaking a new task, whether it is writing something to making a video or something, first do and then compare. Looking at other's work undermines your own creativity and aesthetic sensibility. Sure, do borrow good elements and styles from others, but the first draft has to be uniquely yours. Don't underestimate what your own mind can produce. If you do, then it won't, in a self-fullfilling prophetic way. Do not compromise on innovation.

Stay in the present. 

*When we are present to what is, we are right up front with the expansion of time, but when we make a mistake and get frozen in what was, a layer of detachment builds. Time goes on and we stop. Suddenly, we are living, playing chess, crossing the street with our eyes closed in memory. And then comes the taxicab.* - Josh Waitzkin, The Art of Learning

#### Life Decisions

There's a different in having something and looking like we have the thing. Don't mistake the map for the territory, else you'll never be fulfilled. For example, actual programming vs acting like a programmer. 

Before dreaming of doing anything, look at what you are giving up. Imagine the worst criticisms. (For example - Travelling around the world seems cool. But imagine the self criticism you might inflict on yourself - like being jobless and aimless in life and not adding meaning to anyone else's, of not making a lasting impression. Now the idea doesn't seem so cool afterall). Do the things that can hold itself against the worst critcisms? Also remember, it's always relative, not absolute. Joining Opera was not good in an absolute sense (For me), but other options were far worse at that time. 

Before taking on a task, ask yourself is it meaningful to you because of itself, or because of the sociocultural atmosphere around you. Is it eternally meaningful? In your old age, would you regret the time spent on that? What is your benchmark for social proof - is it your immediate circle, National, or International? Some of the things I have walked away from - BRCA elections, event management, jobs in finance sector- have been according to this principle.

[^eg]: That if you are to become a good poet you have to be writing poem from a young age, that if you are to be be a government head you have to be president of a student union, ...



[^example]: The axioms of a religion - things to be assumed true no matter what, forms their very essense. A typical axiom might take the form of commandements, or might be something general like *jaisi karni waisi bharni* (As you sow so shall you reap).

[^religions]: Ofcourse, it would be much more convenient if were to acknowledge that axiomatic systems are just that, and realise that axioms are supposed to be more like assumptions than objective truth, and and that one system is not superior to another by any objective measure.
