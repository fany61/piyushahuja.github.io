It is said that the environment one is exposed to when he is very young plays a vital role in shaping his future self. Gift a kid toy planes and he dreams of becoming a pilot. Explain to him how things work and you make him a scientist. Let him take apart his gizmos and you wake up the engineer inside.
And if you want him to become a writer, putting up a bookshelf in the room is your best bet. 

But take away all these distractions - the televisions, the gadgets, the toys and the books, and leave him to himself, you give birth to a philosopher. 

By three, Yossarian had already experienced his first existential crises. He wondered what the world is, who he is, what the hell is going and more importantly, why? The why regress would particularly torment him a lot, and he'd break down quite often, and his parents, innocent, unknowing and helpless, would either take him to the washroom, or bring food, and treat him to gentle cuddly swings. This would annoy him even further and the cycle would repeat, until more immediate concerns would come to occupy his questioning young mind - In the following months, Yossarian laboured with the unsettling possibility that the whole world might be just an illusion, and his family and parents might actually be green, one-eyed aliens who have him under a spell. [^vat] His parents and relatives, meanwhile, labelled him as a sensitive child. 

Luckily, school was a savior, and Yossarian learnt to cast aside his angst and discovered the joys of more mainstream kid-thought - cartoons, *Centre Fresh Cricket Cards* and *Hot Wheels*. He also discovered Math and the comfort of numbers. At school, he'd win competitons on mental mathematics and win general knowlege books as prizes. He'd then win competitions on general knowledge and get toy planes and gizmos as prizes.

Like any ten year old, Yossarian dreamt of grandeur. Once fully grown up, he's be crossing the oceans and conquering far-off lands. He's be on top of mountains giving sermons to masses. He'd be sought after for resolving interplanetory disputes. He'd be the foremost authority on philosophical questions related to life, universe and everything. Like any other ten year old, he dreamed of being God. It was the same instinct which draws children to superheroes, an instinct which knows no limits. An instinct which later becomes adulterated with social insecurities, thoughts of mortality and world-weariness.
