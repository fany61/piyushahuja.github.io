Outlining a vision for a nation might seem like an easy task. Everyone has his own opinions on what is wrong and what should be done, without any regard for ground realities and hard facts. Indeed, it is not an easy task. It is difficult, if not impossible to tell what is right and what's wrong in the absence of any real data. One can't run an experiment on countries in order to test claims and hypotheses. Moreover, there might not be any general truths at all. Policies are highly context dependent. What seems intuitively right might be very wrong. 

What can be done? How can robust, good policies be made? What data can we use?
In a sense, we do have abundance of data. We have the history and realities of other nations. We have the history of our own nation. There is even a rare body of economic truths on which all economists have a consensus. And we have methods of simulation which can mirror reality. 

For example, India would do well to learn lessons from the Asian tigers -  Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. Also, countries like Chile, Malaysia and Brazil. Indeed, sound insights could come from as far as Colombia.


"Developed country is not where ...." - Bolivian mayor


There is one reason as to why lessons from the past aren't that applicable in the future - that the world is changing at a very fast pace, and the future holds for us is very, very different from our history.

Indeed, whole countries can be destroyed from the fallacy of thinking this way.
So a central philosophy of this roadmap is that it is forward-looking. 

Another area where policy makers goof up is where they delink theory from context. A policy which worked in one country might not work in another. We need to look at *why* the policy worked, not just what worked. We need to look at the India context, our history and culture, and our existing circumstances into account - especially our strengths and weaknesses.










Lessons from Taiwan (Agricultural Economy, PCI ~ Congo. no natural resources - invested in human capital, -asus, htc, fox con, mobile and laptop manufactures, semiconductors, industrial economy in 80s, and now a knowledge economy)


The Indian public's reaction to government policies and matters of national interest exhibits an interesting dichotomy -  it's either pure indifference (in the spirit of *sab chalta hai* or *humein kya farak padta hai* ) or outright protest (*janata maaf nahi karegi*). 








Growth vs Tax 

Philosophy:

Approaches that never fails for the long run, even though have politically painful short term costs
Definite areas:

- Reduce red-tapisms. Will come through investing in the right human resource. E governeance
- Have a speedy legal system. Better legal infrastructure. 
- 
India needs better infrastructure, especially in power generation and distribution and in transportation, to accelerate the growth of industry and manufacturing, leveraging its ample pool of available labor.



Ride on three big global trends - knowledge, data and networks. Economics of scarcity turned into economics of abundance

Sequences

1. Invest in network infrastructure and ensure last-mile connectivity (internet, telecommunications, roads ) = solve problems of inclusion, empowerment, makes a better infrastructure, encourage investments, problem of access, instead of small pie make sure it is a larger pie, and that everyone gets the pie) (Network Economy) 
2. Leverage the power of data -  UID like programs, ensure welfare programs are effective, decrease the digital divide, a streamline processes digitally, reduce paper work, governance, create efficiencies through data  (Data Economy)
3. Invest in human capital - learning programs, skill building, farming methods, transfer of knowledge (Knowledge Economy) 
Lessons from Taiwan

Market innovative technology solutions which are accessible, affordable, scalable, sustainable, and are designed to be used within the infrastructural constraints of the developing nation. (Approximation Algorithms, tradeoffs, OR)
