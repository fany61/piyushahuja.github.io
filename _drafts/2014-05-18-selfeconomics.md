### The Emotional Economy of the Self

There are some thoughts, which having come up in your mental space time and again, you can't just choose to ignore. It is as if there were an ancient spell, powered by some kind of artistic-morality, which makes it binding on you to give them birth in some form or the other. To give them shape, character, and an existence in the world.[^axioms] 



[^axioms]: Some of these thoughts form the underlying truths of the world as you see it. They might form the guiding framework as you navigate through the world, your axioms of life. They might be the manifestations of your hardwired, innate morality, your neural architecture, or be the products of your social upringing and cultural values. They say much about the world, but also much about you.
