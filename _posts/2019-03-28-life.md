- You are breathing. **You don't know how many days you have left in your life.** [Live today and rejoice in its wonder](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15586159). 

- **Don't wait to take the risks** 'til some perfect time. No perfect time is coming, and the clock IS ticking. Take the f---ing risks. Be utterly foolish. Be embarrassed by the bigness of your dreams, but not stopped by that embarrassment. Blush if you must, but don't ever be held back by "what other people might say."
    * [What is something you learned very late in life, but wish you knew much earlier?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-you-learned-very-late-in-life-but-wish-you-knew-much-earlier/answer/Kelly-Erickson)
    * What would you do if you hit the lottery? How can you do some of that right now?
    *  Take more risks, especially when you’re early on in your career; being young and unknown is actually a major advantage because you have very little to lose. 
    *  Don’t let fear of failing stop you from taking risks. That is a risk itself, because you will miss out by not acting. If you do fail or end up in a crisis, you’ll probably be OK. The more crises I’ve faced in my life, the less scary each subsequent one has become. I’m secure in the knowledge I’ve made it through disaster before and I believe I will again. If you do something new and ambitious, be ready for doomsayers. Doing new things is hard both because you have to figure out how to do it and you have to deal with a constant barrage of negativity.
    * Simple tip – don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. If you’re doing something ambitious, you’ll be told “no”, a lot. Sometimes though, people will give you what you want. Those times will outweigh the pains of being rejected, so be aggressive.
    * [Don't be afraid of failure](https://www.goalcast.com/2017/06/08/j-k-rowling-dont-be-afraid-of-failure/)
    * Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
    * [Things I wish I knew before my chronic illness](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19198812)
    * [Regrets of the Dying](https://bronnieware.com/regrets-of-the-dying/)
    * [Paul Graham's to do list](http://www.paulgraham.com/todo.html)


    
* **Everyone you know is going to die.** 
    * The ones you feel for the most, your parents, would probably be the first.  Your elder relatives will go. Your childhood friends will go. Your college mates, your ex-es, your crushes. All will go. 
        * [Father Time](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/01/07/father-time)
        * [When your father dies, these words come to mind](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/schmich/ct-fathers-day-mary-schmich-met-20160617-column.html)

*  Never be angry. [Be like Inuits](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/685533353/a-playful-way-to-teach-kids-to-control-their-anger)

* Find what makes you happy and do more of that

* Live abundantly
* Live playfully. [It is not a journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHnIJeE3LAI); **life is a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance whilst the music was being played**
* To be on the wire is life; the rest is waiting
*  **Tell the Truth. All the time.**
* [You are wrong](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/4/17989224/intellectual-humility-explained-psychology-replication) about almost everything. And that's okay. Everyone else is, too.

    * [Drop computers](https://dev.to/iskin/how-a-month-without-computers-changed-me-1ho4)

* Life is tragic. You can't have everything; **make the most of what life throws at you.** 
    * Live a life of no regrets. There can be regret with anything you do. You had to make a choice, you did, and that's for the best. [The Road Not Taken](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18837334) is about the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives
    * The Sad, Beautiful Fact That We're All Going To Miss Almost Everything. What we've seen is always going to be [a very small cup dipped out of a very big ocean.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18702370) Take joy in your life now, what you learn now, and your significance to those around. 
    * [Close doors and accept change](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19197548). It's part of life. Embrace it. When you are young, you have all the possibilities of what to do with your life. But as you progress with your life you have to make decisions about what do you want to do, and as you walk through some doors you close most other doors. For example by choosing to become a software dev, you most certainly wont become a doctor, lawyer, cook, house builder or truck driver, although all these options were open to you a couple of years back, now those doors are mostly closed.
