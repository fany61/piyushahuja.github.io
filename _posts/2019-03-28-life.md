* **Everyone you know is going to die.** 
    
    The ones you feel for the most, your parents, would probably be the first.  Your elder relatives will go. Your childhood friends will go. Your college mates, your ex-es, your crushes. All will go.

    * [Who by very slow decay](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/). At the end of life the majority of interactions will be nonverbal as the body shuts down and the person lacks the physical strength, and often even the lung capacity, for long utterances. “People will whisper, and they’ll be brief, single words—that’s all they have energy for.  Medications limit communication. So does dry mouth and lack of dentures. Many people die in such silence, particularly if they have advanced dementia or Alzheimer’s that robbed them of language years earlier. For those who do speak, it seems their vernacular is often banal. From a doctor I heard that people often say, “Oh fuck, oh fuck.” Often it’s the names of wives, husbands, children. “A nurse from the hospice told me that the last words of dying men often resembled each other,” wrote Hajo Schumacher in a September essay in Der Spiegel. “Almost everyone is calling for ‘Mommy’ or ‘Mama’ with the last breath.” Delirium nvolves a loss of consciousness, the inability to find words, restlessness, and a withdrawal from social interaction. Delirium strikes people of all ages after surgery and is also common at the end of life, a frequent sign of dehydration and over-sedation.  “it may even be regarded as exceptional for patients to remain mentally clear throughout the final stages of malignant illness." “I certainly was somewhat tired after the operation and everything … and I did not know where I was. I thought it became like misty, in some way... the outlines were sort of fuzzy.

* Life is tragic. You can't have everything; **make the most of what life throws at you.** 
    * Live a life of no regrets. There can be regret with anything you do. You had to make a choice, you did, and that's for the best. [The Road Not Taken](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18837334) is about the self-deception we practice when constructing the story of our own lives
    * The Sad, Beautiful Fact That We're All Going To Miss Almost Everything. What we've seen is always going to be [a very small cup dipped out of a very big ocean.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18702370) Take joy in your life now, what you learn now, and your significance to those around. 
    * [Close doors and accept change](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19197548). It's part of life. Embrace it. When you are young, you have all the possibilities of what to do with your life. But as you progress with your life you have to make decisions about what do you want to do, and as you walk through some doors you close most other doors. For example by choosing to become a software dev, you most certainly wont become a doctor, lawyer, cook, house builder or truck driver, although all these options were open to you a couple of years back, now those doors are mostly closed.

- You are breathing. **You don't know how many days you have left in your life.** [Live today and rejoice in its wonder](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15586159). 
    
- **Don't wait to take the risks** 'til some perfect time. No perfect time is coming, and the clock IS ticking. Take the f---ing risks. Be utterly foolish. Be embarrassed by the bigness of your dreams, but not stopped by that embarrassment. Blush if you must, but don't ever be held back by "what other people might say." To be on the wire is life; the rest is waiting. [Ask for what you need](https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-you-didn-t-think-you-d-get-but-you-got-because-you-asked). People would let you do anything if you are confident enough (e.g. painting cars with google logo and placing cones in the middle of the street, or putting [‘don’t lock this door tonight’](https://boingboing.net/2014/02/05/social-engineering-the-fbi-in.html) by burglars)

    * What would you do if you hit the lottery? How can you do some of that right now?
    *  Take more risks, especially when you’re early on in your career; being young and unknown is actually a major advantage because you have very little to lose. 
    *  Don’t let fear of failing stop you from taking risks. That is a risk itself, because you will miss out by not acting. If you do fail or end up in a crisis, you’ll probably be OK. The more crises I’ve faced in my life, the less scary each subsequent one has become. I’m secure in the knowledge I’ve made it through disaster before and I believe I will again. If you do something new and ambitious, be ready for doomsayers. Doing new things is hard both because you have to figure out how to do it and you have to deal with a constant barrage of negativity.
    * Simple tip – don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. If you’re doing something ambitious, you’ll be told “no”, a lot. Sometimes though, people will give you what you want. Those times will outweigh the pains of being rejected, so be aggressive.
    * [Don't be afraid of failure](https://www.goalcast.com/2017/06/08/j-k-rowling-dont-be-afraid-of-failure/)
