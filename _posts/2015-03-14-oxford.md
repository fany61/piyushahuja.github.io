I wake up abruptly from a dream. My eyes are groggy, but still drawn towards the daylight peering in through the window. The window almost looks like a painting on medieval architecture: arched windows and towers, domes and spires. The sky is, as expected, grey; the clouds moving at a rocketing speed like in a film in fast motion. If someone were to look at my house from the back side, he's see a blue plaque which reads"George Berkeley was *perceived* to have lived here circa something something ". Back in my room, my shelves too, lined with books, echoes some names: Hume, Mills, Kant, Nagel, Quine, Russell and Putnam. And papers by Krugman, Friedman, Stiglitz and Coase. Most read, some unread. I check the time: still an hour to go before breakfast. It's Tuesday, and that means jambreads, sausages, eggs and bacon along with the usual  cereal, milk, and fruit juices. I take a quick shower, put on Bach's Cello Suites on my speakers and sit down. And at this moment, there is only one question which is lingering in my ahead

"How did I end up here?"

It is difficult to trace out.
