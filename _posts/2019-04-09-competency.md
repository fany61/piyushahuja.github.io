[Best advice on interviewing](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/)

**How to do Mock Interviews?**

Write down a list of things that your interviewers should observe you on:

* Do you explain yourself concisely and clearly?
* Do you talk to everyone in turn or do you speak only to the person asking?
* Do you project confidence with your voice and mannerism?
* Do you sound rushed?
* Do you exude enthusiasm?
* How do you handle pressure questions?

Specifically, the interviewer is trying to answer:

* Do I want to be on a team with this person? Can I rely on them and their work?
* Do I want to be stuck on an airplane with this person? Are they interesting?
* Could I put this person in front of a client? Is this person humble, kind, confident?
* Can I throw massive amounts of data and information at this person? Are they organized in their thinking to synthesize what’s most important?’


------

Research the company to discover specific traits they look for in staff.  Think of your stories in light of the skills the interviewer is looking for. 



> These are intended to measure whether you fit with McKinsey culture (or what your interviewer thinks the culture is). That culture is compassionate, humble, curious, creative, intelligent, eager and confident. It honors leadership, integrity and hard work.


> Google values an open culture, interactions between teams, and focuses on providing the best user experience. In an interview for this role, include experiences from your past that demonstrate you align with all of these traits.
Do a quick  brainstorm on what you think a successful Google employee looks like, and tailor your responses to align with this mentality. Get inside the interviewer’s head (not your own).

**Prepare Stories**

To prepare to interview for this position, you’ll need examples where you demonstrated each of the competencies needed. Make sure you're really sharp on your stories. Each interviewer will probably only ask you 1 experience question, but will probe very deep on that experience (e.g. "what was your initial response?", "how did they react?", "how did you overcome those biases?", "how could you have approached the situation differently?”)

To prepare, I imagined the questions they might ask (it’s not hard, most are variations), wrote them out, and prepared stories. I had about a dozen stories, I really practiced half of them, but all were available. One interviewer told me he didn’t like my example and wanted another one.

I found it helpful to have a narrative structure to my stories:

1.  Time, setting, position, organization, characters
2.  Conflict, what was it and what caused it.
3.  Moment of awareness - what did you realize or have to change about yourself
4.  Resolution - what did you do, specifically in actions.
5.   Result - how did people react, think, fell? Other outcomes?


* Situation: Background of the situation, setting the scene for the interviewer.
* Task: The specifics of what you were required to do/achieve, when, where, and who.
* Action: The steps you actually took, behaviours, characteristics and skills you used.
* Result: Final outcome. What happened, and what you learnt.

Every time you answer, ask yourself, HOW did I do this, explain it in detail. WHY you took certain actions, and WHAT results were achieved. Think also what you learnt, and come up with another time where you used the learnings to do even better. Did you use a process? What process? How did you get the information to make the decision? How did you bring your team on board with your line of sight? What happened? How did your customers react?

- Action. How you approached the task. Describe specific steps you took.
- Thinking. Why choose this course of action. Describe your rationale.`
- Results. What impact did your actions have. Describe the outcomes.
- Learning. Describe what this experience has helped you discover.
- Application. Demonstrate you have grown by using these learnings in a new situation.


Skill Based Stories:

The bread: Impact. Your accomplishment must show you as a contributor who has had a significant  impact on a person, organization, or entity. Your accomplishment could be that you increased membership, led a team to victory, built a  coalition in student government that did something fantastic, increased  sales, cut costs, or found a solution to a problem that enabled a  critical deal to go forward.

The butter: Obstacles overcome. Overcoming lack of resources be they time, money,  innate talent, or people magnifies your accomplishment many fold. Since  we rarely have enough of everything for plans to go smoothly, make sure  you tell the story of the difficulties you faced.

And what if you like jam with it? What would sweeten the dish?

The jam: Leadership. Yes, your accomplishment could be a purely individual and personal one.  And that dish would satisfy, but for most fields, an accomplishment  involving others where you influence, motivate, persuade, cajole, and lead will turn your bread and butter into a delectable delicacy

Some tips:
    
* Answer the question appropriately. For failure, don’t talk about a poor grade or not getting a job. I told a story about how I blasted someone (much higher up), she found out and I had to apologize AND get her to trust me again.
* Present your talents and strengths honestly, don’t embellish negatively or positively. It’s not time to be a sales person nor too modest.
* Draw out the human element; did you understand others? Did you have empathy? Were you compassionate?
* What do you want them to *know*? What do you want them to *feel*? What do you want them to *do*?
* Describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs.  If you have not had the opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the ability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.

**Cover Letter**

Dear Team,

I am an Oxford and IIT Delhi grad, interested in software engineering roles at your company, as mentioned in your [hacker news post](https://news.ycombinator.com/). 

Since last year, I’ve been the tech lead of a startup I founded. Our tech stack is based on the following technologies: Android, Express, Node.js, Mongodb, AWS, and the product is currently live on Google playstore.  Before that, I was a product manager of a consumer-facing on-demand services app used by about 3 million users across 28 cities in India. I am proficient in Java, strong in CS fundamentals, and believe in delivering well-tested, well-documented software which is maintain and extend to unanticipated use cases.

I am currently based in India, seeking new opportunities, and I'd be happy to relocate. I’d love to chat about whether my background might be a good fit.

Summary: 

- Graduated from IIT Delhi with a five-year integrated masters (bachelors + masters) in computer science  in 2013
- Graduated from Oxford in PPE (Philosophy, Politics and Economics) as a second undergrad degree in 2016
- Worked as a product manager in a consumer-facing tech startup for one year (2016-17)
- Founded a startup and led a team of four to ship the flagship product, currently live on Google Playstore  (2017-18)

Please find attached my CV. More details at my website: http://piyushahuja.github.io.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Regards,
Piyush

**My Intro/Tell me about yourself/Why I am the perfect fit for this specific opportunity?**

-  My first degree was in **Computer Science**  **After that, I went to Oxford** for a two years degree in humanities. PPE. I was one of the few places where you could get that in two years, and it is also one of the best, I went there to read for a second undergrad degree
    *  One thing which I have picked from all these different fields is the "The ability to learn super fast". While they look different, common princiles underpin all fields of knowledge.
    *  A diverse background in  also affords me a distinct ability to approach a case from different perspectives and assimilate knowledge from different fields.  
    * Reading under the rigors of the tutorial system at Oxford has helped me develop  time management skills and an ability to get work done under pressure. 
    * Analytical rigour and eye for detail: from my earier drgee

- **My first job out of Oxford was in a  startup in the on-demand sector** as a product manager, Jugnoo.  It was **consumer facing app** used by about **3 million consumers across 28 cities** in India. One thing I got out of that role was a  complete obsession with user experience and **experience handling large-scale, high-volume services.**
    * I can come up with clever ways to improve usage including behavioural economics and design improvements

-  Since last year, I’ve been the **tech lead of Platonia.** Apart from mentoring junior team members, I've been **pretty hands-on with the server side development of the stack of the stack in Node.js**  It is currently live on Google Playstore.  Our team of four  shipped the product in six months. 
> The product didn't take off with the growth rate needed to justify further time and investment.

 **Skill: I get things done. Shipping someithng gets me going**
 
- **looking for more server side development and system architecture** experience. 

--------

**Why should we select you?**



----

**Which project are you most proud of?**
- Since last year, I’ve been the tech lead of Platonia, a startup I founded. 
- Apart from mentoring junior team members, I've been **pretty hands-on with the server side development of the stack of the stack in Node.js** 
-  It is currently live on Google Playstore.  Our team of four shipped the product in six months. I designed, implemented, tested and monitor new functionalities to the platform.
- The product didn't take off with the growth rate needed to justify further time and investment. **Skill: I get things done. Shipping someithng gets me going**


----

**What motivates you?**


----

**What are you passionate about?**

- I am passionate about learning new things. This is what drove me to major in major in both and engineering. I did PPE at Oxford and CS in IIT Delhi, and this is what drove me to software engineering. There is so much to learn! I feel the experience of learning something fresh is what keeps you alive and kicking. Otherwise the world is a little boring. 
- The pursuit of excellence in what I do. I believe in doing a job well, in coming to work every day, and thinking how can I contribute 
- Simplifying complex things

-----

**Skill:Passion for tech and metacognition about coding well**

-  I am proficient in Java - which is strongly typed, object oriented, class-based. Transferring that knowleedge to <X>  would be trivial. 
    -  I prefer statically typed and compiled languages (rather than interpreted ones). They tell me about errors in my code before I run any tests altogether, and once you get used to the boilerplate, you stop even noticing it. It is like dental hygiene, except for code.



**Skill: Experience making system architecture decisions (which stack to use, choice of storage enginers, whether to use microservices)**

**Situation:** During the shipping of Platonia, we made quite a few architectural choices

**Task:** Choose a database for the application. SQL based like PostGreSQL (Relational) vs Mongo (NoSql) or Graph(Neo4J)

**Action:**
    - Made a list of properties we needed from our database
    - Increase speed of writing code and deploying. Presence of an online community and f libraries we can take off-the-shel and wire together  (Ruled out Graph databases)
     - Something well known: Ease of hiring developers (Ruled out Graph databases)
     - Schema flexibiliy in light of evolving data model (Ruled out SQL databases)
    - Something thats Scalable, since if it takes off it should be able to handle loads of millons (Ruled out SQL databases)
- Chose MongoDb based on the above propertes
    - Mongo has many features that you think about relational database: support for joins, indexing and searching on nested data.

**What's something you've worked on that you've been proud of?**s

I recently developed a mobile app from scratch, which about 100+ people used and loved. The app allowed people to connect in-person over skill sharing, and the visition is something I had wanted to execute on since a long time.

-----


**Briefly, what do you like & dislike about your current or latest role?**

What I liked best about my latest role was that it gave me a lot of autonomy, which made me both disciplined and empowered at the same time!

------

**What's the most challenging work you've faced?** (the strangest bug you had to debug on production, the most awful legacy system you needed to interface with, etc... this doesn't need to be a success story)

The most challenging work I faced was in my first job. I was fresh out of college, and I was tasked with finding the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the US bond market. This was a non-trivial task, requiring both creativity, some hypothesis-making, AS well as technical skills to clean, analyse and train models on large swaths of data. Since I was fresh out of college, I had little experience of the ambiguity and practical challenges of working on a real project. This gave me a first taste of it, I learnt a lot, and by the end of it, I was able to produce a report which was quite respectable. It as even published.

----


**Tell me about a time you failed and how you overcame that failure.**


-----

**Tell me about a time you had to change your mind in front of others, what happened?**



----


**Tell me about a time you had to work hard to meet a deadline that was virtually impossible. What did you do? How did you prioritize?**
