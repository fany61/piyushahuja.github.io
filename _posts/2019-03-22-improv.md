#The Mindset
----



**Clean your psychological pipes to have the courage to be vulnerable and authentic**

You might be traumatized, or shame-filled, or resentful. You need to do everything you can to make that channel clean. You need to floss that sucker out with therapy, and coaching, and meditation, and sleep, and running, and good food, and hot-tubs, and friendships, and just a shit ton of weeping for all that has passed down the river of your life. It takes a massive amount of courage and vulnerability to get your channel clean enough that you can be authentic.  This advice applies to everything, from talking technical with a colleague, to presenting to the board, to inspiring your kids. Practice hard, clean out your psychological pipes, and then, when the time comes, let rip on the world with your wit, wisdom, and wokeness.

List of techniques:


- Meditation (e.g. Mindfulness, Vipassana )
- Yoga  (e.g Hatha yoga, Pranayama...)
- Exercise (e.g.  TABATA/Circuit Training/ HIIT)
- Swimming
- Improv 
- Writing
- Sleep
- Good Food
- Slow exposure to fears and anxieties
- Better friendships: choosing positive, empowering people. staying away from those who drain you.
- Gestalt
- CBT

**Intentionally make mistakes** 

**There are no mistakes and the way you are supposed to be. The key is that you are enough. You know enough.** Just have natural reactions. Don’t exert to be funny.  To be unapologetic and just be, just go on, no matter what. 


The trick is to practice like crazy and then let go and surrender into the present-moment. You have to learn how to let your soft animal body take over and channel all that goodness automagically through a fresh pipe.

If, like many people, you’re scared of screwing-up and making mistakes, it can be helpful to sometimes intentionally make mistakes, just to see what happens. By doing this, we challenge the beliefs we hold about the way the world works. When we do something that we assume will not work, we get to explore a space that would otherwise not be visited by ourselves or by others. In the process we often discover little treasures waiting for us.

What this looks like in practice is just being fucking weird every now and then.

- Say something weird. 
- Move weirdly. 
- Do something potentially embarrassing. 
- Sing in the shower. 
- Dance in front of a mirror. 
- Challenge the status quo. For example, if people at work (including you) often seem to be trying to hide the fact that they don’t understand most of what’s going on, experiment with calling that out, “I have no idea what’s going on here. Does anyone else know?” You’ll probably feel a release of tension in the room

**Don’t try to think think up words. Rather, try to feel a certain way. Control what you feel -- not what you're expressing.** 


Words come by automatically. Feeling are central. Ideas are secondary. 
Our brains are horrible at distinguishing fantasy from reality (think about how scared you got last time you watched a scary movie, even though you knew it was just a movie). 


Examples: 

- [Cate Blanchett's emotional interview with Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xhImxF1H98) 
- [Ben Stiller's emotional iterview with Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkESoUBVQDs) 
- Improv Exercise: Portraying the same phrase with different emotions or with exaggerated emotions.



To feel positive, think about something or someone you love for a few moments before an interaction with someone. Your positive emotions will show, and your conversation partner will respond in kind. Pratice the feeling of **Yes, and...**


**People are going to forget what you told them, but they will remember what you made them feel.** Giving people your full presence makes them feel like they're center of your universe. **It isn't about how you make people feel about you. It's how you make them feel about themselves.**


**Tact is the ability to treat people the way they see themselves.** What this means in practice: to communicate your message in such a way that fits with the identity, values and worldview of the other person.


-----


**Listen To understand, not to respond** 

Forget that you are being watched. Live in the space of your situation and engage with the idea space. So often we listen just long enough to get an idea of what the other person is talking about and then we start to prepare our response, while they are still talking. This is “listening to respond.” Instead, it’s better to “listen to understand”. Visualize what the other person is saying. Listen till the last word of a sentence. 
Exercise: Play Last Word, First Word.

**Watch the colour of the eyes of your partner. Observe the physical sensations in your body. Your face. Your toes. How and what do you feel right now?**

Focus on the colors in the eyes of your conversation partner. It's cool to notice the flecks and arrays in their irises. It brings you to the present. And it makes people feel like you're having some kind of deep, cool moment. Don't be creepy and overdo it, though. A little goes a long way. 

Do this for a split second, and it will reset your mind.

**Write and speak a lot every day. Everytime you speak, do it boldly and clearly.** To get better at generating streams of words, you need to practice generating streams of words. 


Being able to say the first thing that comes to mind when you’re onstage is invaluable!




Exercise:

- Start a conversation with a random person on a bus or other means of public transport. Conversational skills are very important in improvisational theatre as you will find yourself in different scenes where you'll have to make your character more believable + you never know what crazy stuff your fellow bus rider has to offer, from settings to characters and situations.
- Write every morning, and I usually have a least one period of social time every day. Once you have stable and good quality content, you can work on tuning the details of how it’s delivered. You can work on tone, and inflection, and timing. You can tease-out that pause before the punchline while making eye contact with someone in the audience. You can slow down, stand up tall, and survey the crowd. You can breathe deeply and soften down into your legs so that your consciousness fills your body and the room, so that you can enthrall and delight the audience, so that you can entice them into your world and entertain them like royalty in your palace of presence.

**Free associate one thought with another: go and explore wherever they take you** 

As you go about your life, associate like crazy. Let your mind and imagination run wild and free. If you see an interesting object, start word-associating with it. 
Seeing a pretty flower might make you think of a vineyard, and then Jack and the Beanstalk, then geese, then Ryan Gosling, etc etc. Make those associations quick and snappy and try to see how far away from the original object you can get.

Caution: Don't do this at job interviews, where structured communication is key. 


----


**Try building stories and worlds**
 
Start with a concept, like seeing a disheveled-looking man ordering a coffee at Starbucks, and build up a story and a life around him. Create a history for him and plan a future. Ask yourself what his family is like, what he does for a living, what he does for fun, etc. If you notice something suitable for world-building, like two squirrels coming out of a tree, construct a fictional universe for them to live in. How are these squirrels related? What’s their language? Is the tree their house? Their place of work? Do they interact with other animals or are squirrels the only sentient animals in this world? Ask yourself world-building questions and then answer them.

**Anthropomorphize to practice character building**

One thing that humans really have going for us is that we see humanity all around us. We are trained to spot faces wherever we look, like in the front grill of a car or an electrical socket. Where there is a face, there is a character. Anthropomorphize everything and develop personalities for them. I find this is easiest to do with cars because their front grills are very expressive faces and their bodywork lends them a good personality. I think of BMWs as snooty french men (because of the moustache) and then the the different models of BMWs have different personalities.
