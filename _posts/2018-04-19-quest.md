The journey starts with a hero who is living a sheltered, particularly unremarkable life. This life is interrupted by a calling - to go on an adventure or to resolve a conflict. His first instinct is to refuse the calling. He wonders whether he is fit to adequately answer it. He fears the unknown. He feels a sense of attachment to his present life.  But then, with the nudge of a mentor and the moral support of companions he is able to overcome these (mostly psychological) barriers and embark on the quest. At some point he crosses a first threshold, leaving the limits of his known world and venturing into an unknown territory, eventually reaching the “belly of the whale”  the final separation from the hero's known world and self, where he undergoes a metamorphosis. 

Every startup is in essence, a story of this quest. The Frodo of the story -  the founder, is on a quest to bring an end to a conflict by solving some customer problem. Your angel investor is your Gandalf, your core team are your Samwise, Merry and Pippin. As you gain traction and leave the Shire for the Bree, you are able to bring better players on board - your Aragorns, who help you cross that treacherous path to product market fit (your Rivendell). At Rivendell you get to raise your Serie A from Elrond and hire a team of experienced A players - your Gimli, Legolas and Boromir. Succeed in this hyper growth phase and a Lady Galadriel would turn up, bestowing you with handsome gifts in the form of a round of Serie B (momentarily threatening to take over your board or replace you as the CEO during the negotiations!). From there on you can branch into separate paths and diversify your business, invest in bold new product offerings and risky experimental projects.
