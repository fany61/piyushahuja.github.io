<hr />
<p>In the summer of 2016, I interned with Aurora Energy Research, an energy analytics provider with a strong presence in the UK. When I joined their modelling division, they were preparing to enter the German market. This presented a very exciting learning opportunity - the company still had a startup like work environment. The team responsible for the German launch had only three other people - so there was a lot of work to be done, a lot of impact to be made. I was given a lot of responsbility and full ownership of my work.  </p>
<hr />
<p>The German launch presentation was to be attended by many important leaders of the German energy sector. An important ingredient of the presentation was our analysis and  and forecast of the cost of Germany&rsquo;s renewable energy subsidy policy (EEG) for the next twenty years. I was tasked with preparing this forecast - termed the (Renewable Energy Sources) Support model. </p>
<p>We divided the model into different subproblems: (1) forecasting capacities for different renewable energy sources in Germany, and (2) calculating subsidies that flowed into all plants based on the forecasted capcities, (3) calculating the burden of subsidies on German consumers, which is levied as EEG surcharge by the German government.<sup id="fnref:Energiwiende"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Energiwiende" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This proved to be a real challenge. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Renewable_Energy_Sources_Act#EEG_surcharge">German energy policy</a> (EEG) had been amended every year since 2000, and different policy versions applied to different energy power plants depending on when they were commissioned.  To create a model with sufficient accuracy we needed extensive data on power plant type, their year of commission, which plants had opted for which marketing plan, estimates on refurbishment, life cycle and expiry - data which wasn&rsquo;t always easily available. My unfamiliarity with German language  didn&rsquo;t make the task any easier. It would have certainly helped - be it reading policy documents written in German, understand the reports of native German thinktanks, or simply interpreting data labelled with German keywords. </p>
<p>But I was determined, and I persisted. I read all the policy documents. I used data from whatever publicly available datasets I could lay my hands on. And I benchmarked the capacity forecasts from reports by other thinktanks. In a little over a month, I the model was complete. It that forecasted renewable electricity surcharge on German consumers for the next 20 years. The excel model was flexible enough to incorporate changes in Aurora’s outlook for the German energy market and future energy policy. </p>
<p>It was a tremendous learning experience where I learnt making a dashboard on excel and using data to measure and predict policy effects. I also developed a know-how of renewable energy technologies. With the RES support model, the company was able to prepare intelligent, data driven outlook on the eeg surcharge, energy retail price and the renewable energy capacity and generation in general for the crucial German launch presentation in November. </p>
<hr />
<p>As a separate initiative, I optimized the data cleaning and loading process used by the team,  speeding up the process­ by. 7200%. I accomplished this by rewriting the previous clunky code in an elegant, dynamic and efficient script. I learnt computer languages R and basic Python for this, which would be useful for data manipulation, analysis and visualization tasks that might be required at Oxera.</p>
<p>As a third task, I also conducted a regression analysis investigating whether the annual average load factor of a county&rsquo;s offshore wind energy varies as it builds more capacity. Regression would be useful in any cause-and-effect economic analysis at Oxera.</p>
<p>Energy Modelling </p>
<p>The modelling division was commonly accepted as the brainy of the company.It had graduate economists and statisticians (Florian Habermacher) who had developed very rigorous, data-driven models for the gas and the power market. For the German entry we were developing a model which forecasted electricity prices for the next twenty years by modelling energy supply and demand and then solving for the market equilibrium in Germany. But since EU is seeing increasing regional intergration: Scandinavia has a common electricity spot market, so would Southern Europe in the near future, and so on, plus the countries have many import and export arrangements, it is impossible to predict the power prices with any reasonable precision without taking modelling the rest of EU to some extent. So we also modelled the supply and demand in the rest of EU, and our model was thus easily extendable to other European countries. And this was especially relevant because Aurora planned to expand to other European countries after Germany.</p>
<p>The Model:</p>
<p>The optimal output to meet the system load from a number of electricity generation facilities in the short term is determined by a model known as economic dispatch. The main idea is that to serve the load at the minimum cost, the set of generators with the lowest marginal cost must be used first, with the marginal cost of the final generator needed to meet the load setting the system marginal cost. This is the cost of delivering one MW of additional electricity into the system (under given transmission and operational constraints).</p>
<p>The power generation from different renewable technologies is a result of many contributing factors. How much installed capacity there is depends on economics and government policy (e.g solar and wind power our encouraged via high subsidy rates and priority grid feed in, but coal is discouraged by levying carbon emission costs, biomass, since its expensive, is being clamped down on, nuclear power is being shut down, and so on.). The load factor (i.e. generation/capacity), that is power generation once capacity is taken into account, then depends on technology related factors (the generation from solar and wind are variable and governed by natural factors: solar and wind offshore produce more during the day, wind onshore produces more during the night, and then there are seasonal variations). </p>
<p>inter-country intorconnectors, regional grid capacities, balancing market, capacity markets, powerplant capacities </p>
<p>The energy supply was modelled not macroscopically, but at the powerplant level. economic dispatch (This is how wholesale electricity prices in the spot markets are determined  )</p>
<p>S: </p>
<p>At Aurora, we had an energy model whose output would be in the form of hundreds of excel sheets with huge amounts of data. This data needed to be fed in the database.
<em> The existing query was long, inelegant: had a separate script for every excel sheet.
</em> Wasn’t adaptable to changes: new requirements and new inputs. For every new excel sheet, one needed to create a new script. For every change, the code had to be changed for each sheet.
* Used Iefficient algorithm  where the code was switching between Java, R and SQL engines for every row of data. This increased the overhead massively.</p>
<p>T: I volunteered to work on the task in the free time I had from my main deliverable. I myself wasn’t proficient in both R and SQL, but I understood the code and spotted the improvements that could be made in the algorithm. </p>
<p>A: I taught myself R and SQL</p>
<p>I changed the design and layout. Instead of writing the code for each sheet, I wrote a modular code based on function. I designed a generic wrapper function, which took as input excel sheets and tasks you want to do, and gives an output of cleaned. It was much more elegant and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Now this function could just be applied to each excel sheet. For any changes or new format to excel sheet, one just needed to change input parameters, or change the line of code in the wrapper function</p>
<p>Instead of inserting each row at a time and using context switching every time, I found out an algorithm to bulk insert and context switch only once every 10000 rows (max limit)</p>
<p>R: The result that a process which took 12 hours before now took only 10 mins.</p>
<p>As an modelling team intern at Aurora Energy Research, I was working with a model whose output was in the form of hundreds of excel sheets with huge amounts of data. This data was cleaned (R), manipulated (Java) and then fed in the database (SQL) using a programming script which was inelegant, error prone, and inefficient. For example, there was a separate code segment for each  file, even though most functions were common across files. For every new excel file one needed to add a new code segment. Also,  the program employed context switching between Java, R and SQL engines for every row of data, which massively increased the overheads. I volunteered to work on rewriting the script in my spare time. I myself wasn’t proficient in the programming languages used, but my algorithmic background helped me understand the code and spot potential improvements. I taught myself R and SQL syntax online, and changed the layout of the script. Instead of a  separate static code segment for each file,  I designed a generic wrapper function, which would work dynamically with any file input. I also implemented an algorithm in which the rows were inserted in bulk, which reduced the context switching costs by an order of magnitude. The new script was faster, elegant and efficient. Importantly, the data loading time improved from 12 hours to just 10 mins. In the end, not only did I pick up valuable skills, but I also got to create long-lasting positive externalities for the entire team.</p>
<p>PROBLEM SOLVING
Context: The years 2008-2015 saw rapid expansion in offshore wind energy for many countries; for example, UK&rsquo;s offshore wind capacity grew from just 88 MW in 2008 to 3 GW by 2013. By 2015, Denmark&rsquo;s Offshore Wind Capacity totalled 1.2 GW, Belgium&rsquo;s around 700 MW and Germany&rsquo;s was 1.5 GW+. Stronger wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s contribution in terms of electricity supplied is higher, and unlike wind over the continent, offshore breezes can be strong in the afternoon, matching the time when people are using the most electricity. As such, as countries  make a transition from fossil fuels to renewables for their primary energy needs, offshore wind power forms an intergral part of their energy policies. Germany, for example, plans to increase its offshore wind capacity to 6.5 GW by 2020 and 15 GW by 2030. </p>
<p>My training in Mathematics at IIT Delhi involved a constant exposure to challenging problems. The problem solving skills I inculcated have been useful in all my professional and academic work. For example, as an intern at  Aurora I was responsible for investigating whether the annual average load factor (actual generation divided by full capacity) of a county&rsquo;s offshore wind energy varies as it builds more capacity. I used the publicly available energy generation data for UK, Germany and Denmark to conduct a regression analysis.  The regression showed that decreasing logarithmic curves allow a good fit for UK, DEU and DNK capacity vs. LF stddev observations. The regression equation provided us with a reliable estimate for the future volatility in offshore output as countries expand their capacities by growing more offshore wind farms. (See Context) . A second example would be my work as an analytics specialist at Opera Solutions, where I was tasked with quantifying the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the US Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) Market in 2012. I used the flood survey map to identify zip codes which were most affected, and identified 45 RMBS deals which were most exposed under those zip codes. I then used Monte Carlo simulation with distribution parameters taken from the post Hurricane Katrina data to find the required future projections for the RMBS market. In both three of my professional stints, I gained invaluable experience and proficiency applying  statistical techniques on real world data, either for forecasting or to extract insights.</p>
<p>S: As part of energy modelling at Aurora, we wanted to know whether a the load factor of a county&rsquo;s wind offshore energy varies with as it builds more capacity</p>
<p>Unlike conventional power plants, the net output or electricity generated from wind farms is uncertain. Depending on the variation on wind speed across time, it can be quite volatile. However, as a country installs more and more offshore wind power, we expect that the volatility  (measured by standard deviation) in its netoutput from those to decrease. This is because the output of one wind farm is not always positively correlated with the output of another wind farm. (As the simplest case, imagine two wind farms. If at one point of time one is experiencing high wind and the other low wind, and vice versa at another point of time, then their net output remains almost uniform, even though they experience high degrees of variation in output individually)</p>
<p>T:  In this study, we put our hypothesis that volatility in net offshore output decreases with increasing total capacity to test. To account for variation in electriciy generation due to installation or decommissioning of further capacities, we track the change in standard deviation of hourly load factor* (instead of net output) with total installed capacity. We find that decreasing logarithmic curves allow a good fit for UK, DEU and DNK capacity vs. LF stddev observeations. The curves  provide us with a reliable estimate for the future volatility in offshore output as countries expand their capacities.
Load factor (or Capacity Factor) is a  measure of how much electricity a power plant actually produces compared to how much it would produce if it operated at full capacity at that point of time (Example: Take a five-megawatt wind turbine. If it produces power of two megawatts, then its load factor at that time instant is 40% (2÷5 = 0.40, i.e. 40%). </p>
<p>A:</p>
<p>R: On the scatterplot, we find the pattern (trendline) of standard deviation of LF vs Capacities for UK is quite apart from those of other countries, while the trendline esp. for Germany Denmark, but also  Belgium, are  closely bunched together. UK experience lesser std dev (lesser variation) in wind output than other countries for the same total installed capacity. This could be because UK is a big island and has a larger range of locations for wind farms, while Germany, Denmark and Belgium have all their offshore windfarms spread over a small location. (In other words, UK has a more diversified portfolio of wind farms). We find that decreasing logarithmic curves allow a good fit for UK, DEU and DNK capacity vs. LF stddev observeations. As countries grow more offshore wind farms, the variation in offshore output would continue decreasing (as wind output becomes more uniform due to a larger spread of windfarms) until it becomes near-flat (when further decrease in variance by installing more farms becomes very difficult - almost impossible)</p>

<p>CHANGE MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>“Tell me about a time where you had to explain a new concept to a colleague.”</p>
<p>They are looking for examples of your verbal communication ability, and skills in influencing. They want to grasp your understanding of the change process, as well as confirm you know that different people need to learn new concepts differently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Talk about the process you took in preparing for the conversation.</li>
<li>Discuss the pivotal point in getting understanding and acceptance from your colleague.</li>
<li>Reflect on why you were successful in explaining this to your colleague.
“What did you do differently that was successful in bringing them on board?”
“What did your colleague say throughout the process?”
“How did they react to your explanation?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Aurora Knowledge Transfer.</p>
<p>S: I was leaving Aurora,   the models I had made  was to be explained to the members who were joining and were going to continue with the task.</p>
<p>T: I prepared a manual-like writeup explaining the features of the model and why certain decisions were made. I also extensively commented on the code and annotated all excel files. And then I asked the new person to go through it before we had the conversation.</p>
<p>Initially it seemed the employees had reservations about the work I had done because they knew I didn’t know German and the work required a detailed understanding of the German energy policy. But over the course of explaining to them how the model works, it seemed that they themselves had some misconceptions based on a misreading of the policy.( Some parts of the policy were ambiguous and only became clear when you looked at the actual data of how the policy is implemented: I had worked with the data).</p>
<p>When I corrected them, and they double checked that my reading was correct, then I was able to gain their trust and respect. 
They were convinced that I did pay attention to all the nuances of the policy and was the authority on the subject.</p>
<p>They became more engaged with what I was explaining, asking more questions, and also followed up frequently on different aspects of the policy which they wanted to understand.</p>

<p>The German Government passed support for  an energy turnaround (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energiewende_in_Germany">&lsquo;EnergyWiende&rsquo;</a>) to a low-carbon and nuclear-free energy supply in 2010. The policy gave priority grid access to renewable technologies (and compensation if the grid operator is not able to connect it to the grid) and immunity from market price risks via technology-dependent subsidies for 20 years. The costs of subsidies are passed onto the consummer via an EEG surcharge, levied on top of the electricity unit price.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Energiwiende" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
