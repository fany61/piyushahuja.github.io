Think of your stories in light of the skills the interviewer is looking for. Make sure you're really sharp on your stories. Each interviewer will probably only ask you 1 experience question, but will probe very deep on that experience (e.g. "what was your initial response?", "how did they react?", "how did you overcome those biases?", "how could you have approached the situation differently?”)

There were more or less two aspects of interview; the “fit” questions, and the “case” questions.

These are intended to measure whether you fit with McKinsey culture (or what your interviewer thinks the culture is). That culture is compassionate, humble, curious, creative, intelligent, eager and confident. It honors leadership, integrity and hard work.

Specifically, the interviewer is trying to answer:

* Do I want to be on a team with this person? Can I rely on them and their work?
* Do I want to be stuck on an airplane with this person? Are they interesting?
* Could I put this person in front of a client? Is this person humble, kind, confident?
* Can I throw massive amounts of data and information at this person? Are they organized in their thinking to synthesize what’s most important?’

Write down a list of things that your interviewers should observe you on:

* Do you explain yourself concisely and clearly?
* Do you talk to everyone in turn or do you speak only to the person asking?
* Do you project confidence with your voice and mannerism?
*  Do you sound rushed?
* Do you exude enthusiasm?
* How do you handle pressure questions?

The questions they ask could include:

* Tell me about a time you led people to do something they didn’t want to do. 
* Tell me about a time you failed and how you overcame that failure.
* Tell me about a time you had to change your mind in front of others, what happened?
* Tell me about a time you had to work hard to meet a deadline that was virtually impossible. What did you do? How did you prioritize?
* Tell me about yourself
* What are your strengths?
* What are your weaknesses? Why should I hire you?
* Tell me an experience where you have <fill in a challenge> in your job, and what  have you done to overcome the challenge?

To prepare, I imagined the questions they might ask (it’s not hard, most are variations), wrote them out, and prepared stories. I had about a dozen stories, I really practiced half of them, but all were available. One interviewer told me he didn’t like my example and wanted another one.

I found it helpful to have a narrative structure to my stories:
1. Time, setting, position, organization, characters
2. Conflict, what was it and what caused it.
3. Moment of awareness - what did you realize or have to change about yourself
4. Resolution - what did you do, specifically in actions.
5. Result - how did people react, think, fell? Other outcomes?

Some tips:
* Don’t repeat stories to different interviewers, they share notes.
* Answer the question appropriately. For failure, don’t talk about a poor grade or not getting a job. I told a story about how I blasted someone (much higher up), she found out and I had to apologize AND get her to trust me again.
* Present your talents and strengths honestly, don’t embellish negatively or positively. It’s not time to be a sales person nor too modest.
* Draw out the human element; did you understand others? Did you have empathy? Were you compassionate?
* Interviewers don’t sit back and let you talk, they ask questions, want details, they might even steer the story. Practice with colleagues.

1. To prepare to interview for this position, you’ll need examples where you demonstrated each of the competencies needed.
2. In addition, research the company to discover specific traits they look for in staff. Google values an open culture, interactions between teams, and focuses on providing the best user experience. In an interview for this role, include experiences from your past that demonstrate you align with all of these traits.
3. Finally, do a quick  brainstorm on what you think a successful Google employee looks like, and tailor your responses to align with this mentality. Get inside the interviewer’s head (not your own). 

* Situation: Background of the situation, setting the scene for the interviewer.
* Task: The specifics of what you were required to do/achieve, when, where, and who.
* Action: The steps you actually took, behaviours, characteristics and skills you used.
* Result: Final outcome. What happened, and what you learnt.

Every time you answer, ask yourself, HOW did I do this, explain it in detail. WHY you took certain actions, and WHAT results were achieved. Think also what you learnt, and come up with another time where you used the learnings to do even better. Did you use a process? What process? How did you get the information to make the decision? How did you bring your team on board with your line of sight? What happened? How did your customers react?

- Action. How you approached the task. Describe specific steps you took.
- Thinking. Why choose this course of action. Describe your rationale.`
- Results. What impact did your actions have. Describe the outcomes.
- Learning. Describe what this experience has helped you discover.
- Application. Demonstrate you have grown by using these learnings in a new situation.


Skill Based Stories:

The bread: Impact. Your accomplishment must show you as a contributor who has had a significant  impact on a person, organization, or entity. Your accomplishment could be that you increased membership, led a team to victory, built a  coalition in student government that did something fantastic, increased  sales, cut costs, or found a solution to a problem that enabled a  critical deal to go forward.

The butter: Obstacles overcome. Overcoming lack of resources be they time, money,  innate talent, or people magnifies your accomplishment many fold. Since  we rarely have enough of everything for plans to go smoothly, make sure  you tell the story of the difficulties you faced.

And what if you like jam with it? What would sweeten the dish?

The jam: Leadership. Yes, your accomplishment could be a purely individual and personal one.  And that dish would satisfy, but for most fields, an accomplishment  involving others where you influence, motivate, persuade, cajole, and lead will turn your bread and butter into a delectable delicacy
