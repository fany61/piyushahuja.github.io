“I am going to pretend that didnt happen….”

“You've heard the saying 'alls well that ends well. Where speeches are concerned, I believe alls well that ends, and now is my time to end.”
“When a speaker says 'to make a long story short', its usually too late. I dont want you all to feel that way about me. Goodnight.
“iii dont want any applause, not that I was going to get any, but Id like everyone to stand up. 
“Now lets open for question and answers.if I KNOW THE ANSWER, i'll give it to you. else I'll just make something up. 
“ok' name' thats the last time I've used one of your jokes.”
“my talks usually have a happy ending.its because everyone is happy that it ended”.


  

Structure is important! 
to be able to explain something - which you have understood - eloquently and succinctly to someone, one just needs to start with a strategic framework in the mind, and a working understanding of how information can best be organised and structured in an explanation path.
From my own experience in coaching people, information can be best organised and structured as follows, from the explanatory standpoint:
- listing or enumeration;
- topical;
- definition;
- classification
- process;
- chronological;
- compare and contrast;
- order of importance;
- sequence;
- spatial;
- cause and effect;
- problem:solution

For example, when explaining something that is a listing or enumeration, the strategic framework one holds in the head is to use a numerical sequence to explain the information.
If it's a process that you are explaining, you know very well that a process always involves stages or steps, in a sequence.
That's to say, there's a start-point, an end-point, and a developmental path of transition points in between.
With such a strategic framework in the mind, your explanatory path just follows the sequence.
