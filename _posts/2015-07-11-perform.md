Structured procrastination

https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/02/john-steinbeck-working-days/

When I know what needs to get done, even if it's tedious, it's not so bad to put my nose to the grindstone and work through it. But when I'm not sure how to approach a task, suddenly every distraction in the world is more appealing.
You often see the suggestion to break up big tasks into smaller, baby step chunks to avoid this analysis paralysis

//1) Start screen recording software and dictate your thoughts as you go through the research/brainstorming phase. Don't often go back and view the recorded sessions, it's the act of recording and speaking out loud that helps.

//2) Comment driven development. Stub out functions just with comments, write deeper comment blocks inside a procedure where you have a rough idea of what needs to happen. I paste in table and API definitions as comments too, to avoid having to flip to a different screen which inevitably leads to distraction. Once the program is completely laid out in comment form, and compile/runs with just "STARTING" and "STOPPING" displaying, then I start implementing what's in the comments outside-in (from highest to lowest level). I run the program frequently while doing this, each successful compile/run is a small dopamine hit. As I'm going through, remove any comments that are duplicated by code - all that should remain are comments explaining "why".

- The most effective strategy I have come across is to "change your identity". If you identify as an athlete, and you talk to yourself and others with that expectation, then that is much more effective than "I need to get in better shape". When you identify with something it compels your actions, almost by default, much more than willpower alone.

* Excellence is mundane.  Excellence is accomplished through the doing of actions, ordinary in themselves, performed consistently and carefully, habitualized, compounded together, added up over time. The action in itself is nothing special, the care and consistency with which it is made is special.

Reimagine the task. You can also make your task itself more appealing, more engaging, by looking at it in a different light. “My friend Ian Bogost is a professor at Georgia Tech, and he studies play. It's fascinating. He wrote a book called Play Anything. What he said is that you can make any task into play and to make it fun by looking for the variability inside the task.“Even if a task at first seems boring, look for the variabilities. Look for the uncertainty,” says Eyal. “Look for what might be different. You might time yourself. You might see if you can do it a little differently. You might see if you can do it a little bit better.”

**Just show up**

* Walk, run, bike, skip to the places that you need to be.
* Motivation is not a prerequisite for showing up.
* Start your day with what is important.
* Use rituals to get things going.
* Showing up to help others is already service.
* Change your vantage point and refresh your mind.
* Location, location, location--in real estate and in life.
* Be on time for the sake of others.
* Show up on time for yourself. Lost time is never found.



**Start anywhere**
* All starting points are equally valid.
* Begin with what seems obvious.
* Once it is under way any task seems smaller.
* When speaking in public don't use a script. Write down questions and answer them.
* Talk to your audience. Don't give a lecture.
* Trust your mind.
* Edit and develop ideas *as* you speak.

Before they start doing anything, great improvisers focus on the big picture. The details will follow spontaneously once they start improvising and experimenting. If you want to plan all the details in advance, you will spend a lot of time only to discover that reality is more resilient than you thought. It is only through experimentation that you will find out what does and doesn’t work. Practice exploration and discovery. 

**Act now**

* The essence of improving is action.
* Act in order to discover what comes next.
* You don't need to feel like doing something to do it.
* Schedule a difficult task and stick to your timetable.
* Invite a buddy to join you in doing what you need to do.
* Do the hard things first.
* To find a new perspective, try doing something a different way.
* Sometimes *not doing* is what is needed.
* If you can't get out of it, *get into it*.

**Stay on course. Go Bird by Bird**

* Every improvisation has a point.
* Don't let feelings alone run your show.
* There is meaning in everything we do, even small tasks.
* Keep an eye on where you are going. If you miss the target, adjust your aim.
* Ask often "What is my purpose?"
* What would not get done if you were not here?
Decide what you want to do and work incrementally towards achieving that.

Don’t confuse action with motion .  Instead of running around in circles, take clear action steps towards your purpose. Feeling like you are always doing so much and keeping yourself busy is a waste of energy. Focus on the 20% of actions needed to accomplish 80% of what matters. This rule might sound like a cliché, but sometimes the biggest truths hide under the obvious reasons. A windmill might look like it’s spinning so fast, but still it doesn’t go anywhere.ough, let go and focus on expanding your strengths.
