# Interview Mindset 101


Think about this: if you cannot persuade a person to hire you for the skills you are good at,  how do you even expect to win friends and influence people in any other sphere of life?  How are you going to persuade investors to back your vision with their capital? How are you going to woo a person you want to spend the of your life with? How would you befriend a person you respect and admire? How would you command the loyalty of your followers?

All of these areas of life depend on the same basic primitives, and it is worth it to spend some time mindfully honing them.  

--

**Be the person would you want to hire if you were hiring for your startup. Aim high. Don’t strive to merely clear the bar, strive to set it.**

There’s a big difference between “barely good enough” and “absolutely good enough”. Strive for the latter!  If you get to a point where you think you know enough to get an offer, that’s great. Interview performance obviously helps decide if you get an offer from a given company, but it also helps decide what that offer looks like. 

To keep in mind:  Do not mistake arrogance for confidence. You demonstrate confidence when you are comfortable (not to be confused with complacency) with what you don't know, and showing intellectual curiosity/eagerness to learn.

**View the interaction with the right metaphors.**
Is it a role-playing exercise where you are pretending to be coworkers trying to solve problems together? 
Or is it a one-sided "test" where you are put on a spot to defend yourself?  

Sure you'd be the one leading the problem solving, but being capable to explain your thought process effectively, having the ability to exchange ideas with the interviewer, and just being able to come across as a good teammate is probably more important than getting that last 5% of optimization. This is especially more true for senior level position interviews where there are more design/architecture problems with relatively open answers. 



**In the first few minutes of chit-chat with the interviewer: explain any sort of experience which sets you apart.** Relevant projects, significant technical accomplishments, and the like. Remember, the person conducting the interview has interviewed dozens if not hundreds of smart people just like you. So what can you say that would surprise them?
For example, in an interview I spoke to the interviewer about a program I wrote to play the game of Go in college. It is very difficult to write an AI for the game of Go, and I have a horrible Go-bot to prove it! The bottom line is be yourself, and not just some smart person who knows how to program.



> Explicitly check on their response to your words: “Is this making sense to you? You can't see their reaction or body language, so you have to use words to get the same effect.



They want to hire you! The life-blood of any software company is its employees. It's looking to hire the best and the brightest and the people conducting the interview want you to succede just as much as you do.

## Them, not You.


- Show Enthusiasm for the company. Carefully preparing notes on why you find a company exciting. You can even reference the notes during the interview. Bringing prepared notes shows preparation.  The best approach is to prepare notes before an interview about what you find exciting about the company, and bring this up with each interviewer when they ask if you have any questions. A good source of ideas is to read the company’s recent blog posts and press releases and note the ones you find exciting. Convince the company it’s your dream job.   Employees who are excited about the mission of a company will work harder and be happier, and companies know this.

Overcoming Nerves: Focusing on helping others

Nerves are caused by one reason - you are focusing on yourself, instead of focusing on others.

It's perfectly normal, of course, to focus on ourselves. However, during performance time, focusing on oneself achieves the opposite effect of what we actually want. It causes us to freeze in action and actually end up performing worse, potentially creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Such focus is due to fear of failure. When we are young, stage fright is an unknown experience. Look at how little kids are able to perform in front of audience without much concern, and even though they might not be great performers, their joy and lack of stage fright is something that all adult performers work hard to reclaim. Can we do what little kids do? Yes we can - by stop being concerned about our performances. Allow Yourself The Room To Suck. "Perfect is the enemy of good."  — Voltaire

In interview situations, it's actually worse than that. In wanting to put the best foot forward, we often end up shooting ourselves in the foot when we are so focused on being perfect.

Little kids do not know what being perfect is - kids *are* perfect, period. Anything they do is fine, and their enthusiasm/optimism carry the day.

Adults have more standards to live by, of course.  But by not being concerned about how well you perform, you'll automatically be more relaxed, and actually end up performing better.

It's actually a bit trickier than "stop worrying about how well you will perform" though. Because whenever we tell ourselves not to think of something, that something is exactly what we end up thinking about.

What we need to do instead is to have "something else" replacing the "original something".

The best "something else" in interview situation is to think about how you can help others, by focusing on answering the following questions

* How can you help the company?
* What problems are they trying to solve?
* How will you help solve their problem?
* What skills do you bring to the table?
* What intangibles will benefit your new employer?
* Are you the right person to help them?

The more you think in this fashion, the less you'll be concerned about your own performance, and the more value your interviewers will actually find you bring to the table.

The goal in the interview is to immediately add value. Why else would they be hiring you? Always focus on the other party. You'll reduce your own fear, and actually make others like you more than otherwise.


Be Willing to Walk Away: The by-product of focusing on helping others is this - if you are not the right person, you should be willing to walk away. Think of it this way - if you are the wrong person, you might actually end up causing more problems. You don't want to be the person that cause others more problems if you really are trying to help. Hence - willingness to walk away signifies true desire to help others. And if you are willing to walk away - what is the reason to fear?

Questions to ask

Heuristic: Any question you ask and everything you say should be framed from the perspective of the employer and for the benefit of the employer.

- 1. What do you need me to get done in the first couple of months on the job?

Lead with this question. Add that you want to hit the ground running. Ask clarifying questions about anything you can do before you even get to the job. Take lots of notes as the employer responds.

- 2. How many people have you hired in the past six months and in what positions?

This tells you where the company is growing and potential areas where you can help if positions are unfilled. Make that explicit as appropriate. Shows interest in success & future of the company.

- More
3. What's the biggest challenge for the team right now?

Shows you see your success as team success. Forces interviewer to level psychologically with you. Opportunity to reveal a niche where you have advantage over other candidates. Doubles down on showing your performance focus.

 

4. What are the common attributes of your most successful projects, employees etc.?

Suggests you want to be a top performer and are actively looking for fit with the team. Opportunity to reveal & highlight niche skill of yours. Psychological association between you & top doers.

‏
 

5. What are the top features on my resume that made you want to hire me?

Makes the interviewer think past the sale & highlight your highest-value skills with one's own words. Reveals what you might want to emphasize in rest of interview & any subsequent rounds.



6. What is the biggest shortcoming among other candidates for the job?

Makes the interviewer focus on your competitors weaknesses. May reveal advantages to talk about for rest of interview & any subsequent rounds. Levels the interviewer with you psychologically.


7. How do you typically unwind from work? What do you do in your spare time?

Shows personal interest & allows the interviewer to talk about his/her favorite subject - oneself. Creates psychological association with something enjoyable (vacation, hobby etc.). Levels you together.


8. How does the company plan to deal with [insert competitive or other threat]?

Shows you know the market and the environment, the direction of the industry overall. Shows interest in future of the company & you've made an effort to prep for the interview. Levels you together.



9. How did you get the position you're at (what skills, achievements etc.)?

Prompts the interviewer to talk about him/herself, esp. one's successes. Suggests interest in career at the company/industry & how the firm works on the "people" level. Seeds opportunity to compliment.



10. What's the most important internal driver of performance for the organization?

Shows you get that the dynamics of any organization are driven by something other than the P&L. Is it successful because focus on cost? Quality? Customer service? Then link to your own strengths.


BONUS: You can benefit from variants of these questions as a sales person, especially if you are building a longer-term relationship with the customer. Use your big brain.

### - Focus on the skills, not THEM

- Demonstrate Passion. Smart people are passionate about the projects they work on. They get very excited talking about the subject. They talk quickly, and get animated. Being passionately negative can be just as good a sign. “My last boss wanted to do everything on VAX computers because it was all he understood. What a dope!” There are far too many people around that can work on something and not really care one way or the other. It’s hard to get people like this motivated about anything. Bad candidates just don’t care and will not get enthusiastic at all during the interview. A really good sign that a candidate is passionate about something is that when they are talking about it, they will forget for a moment that they are in an interview. Sometimes a candidate comes in who is very nervous about being in an interview situation—this is normal, of course, and I always ignore it. But then when you get them talking about Computational Monochromatic Art they will get extremely excited and lose all signs of nervousness. Good. I like passionate people who really care. (To see an example of Computational Monochromatic Art try unplugging your monitor.) You can challenge them on something (try it—wait for them to say something that’s probably true and say “that couldn’t be true”) and they will defend themselves, even if they were sweating five minutes ago, because they care so much they forget that you are going to be making Major Decisions About Their Life soon.


- If you know more, show it. There were multiple examples during my onsites where I would answer a question and mention some other knowledge I had but explain that I didn’t have time in an interview to fully implement that solution. Answering a question about strings? Show off your Unicode knowledge with your solution or explain how to support Unicode. Implementing a private method? Talk about the Objective-C conventions for methods. Updating a table view? Talk about the different animations you can support. Don’t bring something up if you can’t talk all about it, but if you can, it allows you to show knowledge outside of the narrow window provided by the question and gives you a leg up on anyone that sticks strictly to the beaten path.

- Demonstrate that you "Get things done"  People who Get Things Done but are not Smart decide to refactor your core algorithms to use the Visitor Pattern, which they just read about the night before, and completely misunderstood, and instead of simple loops adding up items in an array you’ve got an AdderVistior class (yes, it’s spelled wrong) and a VisitationArrangingOfficer singleton and none of your code works any more. 

- If the project was a team project, look for signs that they took a leadership role. A candidate might say, “We were working on X, but the boss said Y and the client said Z.” I’ll ask, “So what did you do?” A good answer to this might be “I got together with the other members of the team and wrote a proposal” A bad answer might be, “Well, there was nothing I could do. It was an impossible situation.” Remember, Smart and Gets Things Done. The only way you’re going to be able to tell if somebody Gets Things Done is to see if historically they have tended to get things done in the past. In fact, you can even ask them directly to give you an example from their recent past when they took a leadership role and got something done—overcoming some institutional inertia, for example.

##Practice


Pactice, Practice, Practice. Conduct short sessions of interview and critiques.

To convert from thinking silently, there is no better way to practice than with mock interviews.  Make sure you specifically instruct your mock interviewers to call you out when you start to think silently. There you go. For the nontrivial questions that you have to "think" about - apply the process to subdivide your thinking and share them. Your interviewers will thank you. You'll thank yourself.
Your goal isn't to simulate the whole session, at least not until the very end. In the beginning, your goal is to get feedback as soon as possible, so you can quickly correct and incorporate the feedback into your responses. It generally is easier to have real time feedbacks, but for group interview it might be best to have people jot down the feedback during a 15 minute question period followed by 15 minute critiques, rather than continuously interrupting the flow of the session.

If you have never jumped off an airplane before, the thought of skydiving will be positively frightening. But if you have already skydived one hundred times, while you might still feel the rush, you will no longer feel the same panic as you did the first time. Hence, the best way to handle the nerve caused by interviews is to go through more interviews. 

Short of going through real interviews, mock interviews is the next best choice.

And mock interviews are better than real interviews in many ways, including the fact you'll have much more feedback that are immediately useful. Unfortunately few people will actually go through mock interviews. But other people's lack of effort can be your advantage - every mock interview you put yourself through, you'll gain just that much more competitive advantage against others who are winging it.

Very few performers will get on stages without practices - you definitely should practice, too. You can hire professionals to conduct mock interviews with you, or you can find friends & family to fill the role. Just keep in mind that with friends and families you'll have to do more grunt work for them to be helpful to you.
Eventually you would want to conduct a full session end-to-end after enough small practices.
Throughout the session you should ensure that the feedback has become increasingly positive. This will give you a visible improvement progress that can boost your confidence.
With enough practice, you'll find yourself much better prepared to handle the real thing, and you'll find the effort worth it.

It is critical, in my opinion, to either whiteboard problems with someone or mock a phone interview with someone. Not critical as in “very important”, but critical as in you should consider it an absolute requirement when studying. I’m sure you can get a job without it, but it’s the single best form of practice I had.If anyone wants to mock phone interviews for iOS I’d be happy to help out — you may be able to find me on CS Career Hackers and maybe we can work something out, time permitting. If not me, there are plenty of others there willing to help out. It’ll be awkward. That’s the point. If it were natural you wouldn’t need to practice it, would you? If you start practicing on the phone or on a whiteboard and it’s embarrassing or awkward, it’s a sign you’re doing exactly what you should be: practicing. It was pretty awkward for me until it wasn’t, and the practice absolutely paid off Practicing with a friend is everything else. Whether on a whiteboard or on something like Codeshare, simulating an interview environment with someone over a period of time takes a lot of the scariness out of interviews. You get over the awkwardness of verbalizing something totally stupid to someone because your brain slipped. The best is if you can make sure someone understands a problem you haven’t seen before, as they can give you hints to push you toward a solution. Seriously, that kind of practice is invaluable.

Practice. Then practice again.
It makes a world of difference. Especially with the pressure of an interview. Practice with a friend on a whiteboard with a 45–60 minute time constraint. Then ask for direct feedback. I’d even record it, watch it later and see how you discussed certain things. Then reverse the roles. Sometimes, you’ll learn more being the interviewer. Not to take it to extremes, but consider teaching it to a friend or two. This is often how you absorb information at a faster rate.

Get solid interview experience. Interviewing itself is a skill, and you don't want to be honing that skill when it matters most. The more you interview, the more comfortable you will get. Everything else will follow when you just chill out and convey your thoughts clearly. Do a hundred interviews for jobs you may not even want to prepare you for the one you actually want. Learn to sell yourself before you try to sell your technical skills.

Understand why the interviewer is asking the question and tell them what they want to hear.

Interviewers have a purpose for every question. Technical interviewers are trying to get you to demonstrate a range of skills. Behavioral questions (“Tell me about a time…”) are looking for a soft skill. If you think about the question briefly, you can guess what specifically they're seeking. Often it's directly stated in the wording of the question!
For example, if someone asks you to “write the code to reverse a linked list”, what they're looking for is:
1. Can you write actual code in some language? (“write the code”)
2. Do you know what a linked list is?
3. Do you know how to use pointers and loops? (required elements of the solution)
By the way, this isn't a great question, except for a student, because it's too simple.
Another example: “Tell me about a time when you led a team.” This looking for:
1. Have you led a team?
2. What size team?
3. Was your role as leader formal or informal?
4. How did it go?
5. How do you act as a leader? Are you skilled? What is your style?
If they're doing their job, you can't fake any of this. But you can make sure that you effectively convey the information they're looking for. For example:
“In my last role, I was the informal lead of our 5 person project team building a widget. We were executing poorly so I focused on building a culture of accountability through clear goals everyone agreed on. One person didn't like that and left, which is fine. In the end we shipped our feature on time and customers liked it.”
In 4 sentences you've answered the interviewer’s 5 implicit questions, and you've landed the message that you are someone who believes in strong accountability. Some people talk for 20 minutes and don't convey nearly as much information! With their key questions answered, the interviewer will be relaxed, engaged and receptive to the rest of what you have to say.

GENERAL: DEMONSTRATE WHAT THE INTERVIEWER IS LOOKING FOR


Interview questions are easy if you are confident in your abilities, have all the time in the world, and look at problems as a game. They’re hard if you encounter them in an interview, or while preparing for interviews.
If you’re interview prepping, and don’t see a solution immediately, it’s easy to think you’re not good enough, and that can easily distract you from finding a solution.
That doesn’t happen if you’re doing it for fun.

http://www.pgbovine.net/programming-interview-tips.htm
Warm up your voice.  For interview purposes, a short conversation or a little singing should do the trick. You don't want to sound tired, burned out, or bored. 

Drink Water. Have some on-hand during the interview. A quick sip can clear up a dry, scratchy throat. If you have a particularly sore throat then warm water with honey and lemon will help you battle through.

Speak slowly. We all tend to speed up when we're nervous or excited.

Be mindful: listen to yourself. Take a moment in an interview to consider how you sound and be sure you're not talking too loud, too fast etc.

There are a few other small things you can do:
*  Being sure to mention working in multiple programming languages (if you have) can avoid an anti-pattern that companies look for.
*  If do have credentials (degrees from a famous school or work at a famous company) name dropping in the interview will bias the outcome in your favor.

Interviewers have a purpose for every question. They've asked this question a 1000 times and is well versed in the possible solutions. He’ll quickly find out how much you actually understand.  Technical interviewers are trying to get you to demonstrate a range of skills.  If you think about the question briefly, you can guess what specifically they're seeking. Often it's directly stated in the wording of the question. 

Demonstrate Great Communication Skills 
Good candidates are careful to explain things well, at whatever level. I have rejected candidates because when they talked about their previous project, they couldn’t explain it in terms that a normal person could understand. Often CS majors will just assume that everyone knows what Bates Theorem is or what O(log n) means. If they start doing this, stop them for a minute and say, “could you do me a favor, just for the sake of the exercise, could you please explain this in terms my grandmother could understand.” At this point many people will still continue to use jargon and will completely fail to make themselves understood. Gong! You don’t want to hire them, basically, because they are not smart enough to comprehend what it takes to make other people understand their idea.

The first good sign is that you don’t have to explain things over and over again. The conversation just flows. Often, the candidate says something that shows real insight, or brains, or mental acuity. So an important part of the interview is creating a situation where someone can show you how smart they are. If you find yourself explaining everything three times, either you’re terrible at explaining things, or you’re talking to someone who is not that smart. The worst kind of interviewer is the blowhard. That’s the kind who blabs the whole time and barely leaves the candidate time to say, “yes, that’s so true, I couldn’t agree with you more.” Blowhards hire everyone; they think that the candidate must be smart because “he thinks so much like me!”. The bottom line in my interviewing technique is that smart people can generally tell if they’re talking to other smart people by having a conversation with them on a difficult or highly technical subject, and the interview question is really just a pretext to have a conversation on a difficult subject so that the interviewer’s judgment can form an opinion on whether this is a smart person or not.  





Politics. Behind the boring list of past employers on the resume, there’s always a story. What I’m looking for is the story of how the candidate handled challenges in the past. I’m looking for people that got things done, even in the face of opposition. I’m looking for people who challenged the status quo, who overcame objections, and who made things happen. So when the resume says, “drove the adoption of .NET,” I want to hear what drove means. In detail. When the resume says that they “founded a company,” I want to hear everything. Whose idea was it? Who convinced whom? Who did what? Did it work out? Why not? Prepare to describe how you solved a few good problems in your current or previous work role, preferably related to the position you’re applying for. You have to describe your part in it, the rationale behind the decision made, and, if given a chance, what/how you would have done differently.
 
Talk Technology. If someone tells me that they implemented such-and-such a project, I’ll ask detailed questions about the technology they used and how they used it. I’ll also ask specifically what role they played. Sole developer? Developer on a team? I’ll tend to go into these questions in great detail, because this is where you uncover the people who either didn’t know what they were doing, or have made things up, or have exaggerated their own roles. If someone’s resume implies that they spent two years coding in Python, for example, I’m going to drill down until I’m pretty confident that it sounds like they really have two years of Python experience. 
Don’t hesitate to use trick questions. I might say, “I hate Python, because it’s really tedious to declare all your variables. That’s why I like C better.” Python doesn’t make you declare variables (and C does). Don’t be afraid that the candidate will feel pressured to agree with your false assertion. Smart programmers have a certain affinity for the truth, and they’ll call you on it. As Dave Winer says, “You can’t lie to a compiler.” If they’re really good, they’ll find a way to be diplomatic about it. But they’re going to be passionate enough that they’ll almost forget that they’re in an interview. That’s a good sign.
The mistake that many engineers make on this question is to talk about a technically interesting side-project. Many programmers choose to talk about implementing a neural network classifier, or writing a Twitter grammar bot. These are bad choices because it’s very hard for the interviewer to judge their scope. Many candidates exaggerate simple side projects (sometimes that never actually worked), and the interviewer has no way to tell if you are doing this.
The solution is to choose a project that produced results, and highlight the results. This often involves picking a less technically interesting project, but it’s worth it. Think (ahead of time) of the programming you’ve done that had the largest real-world impact. If you’ve written a iOS game, and 50k people have downloaded it, the download number makes it a good option. If you’ve written an admin interface during an internship that was deployed to the entire admin staff, the deployment makes it a good thing to talk about. Selecting a practical project will also communicate to the company that you focus on actual work. Programmer too focused on interesting tech is an anti-pattern that companies screen against (these programmers are sometimes not productive). 




 Examples of things interviewers are looking for:


* Do they didn’t think about any corner case?
* Do they make a lot of assumptions about the problem without clarifying details?
* Do they have any communication issues - both in terms of their communication skills in general and in terms of simply struggling with English?
* Do they poorly incorporated  feedback? Were they good at picking my hints?
* Were they too slow on mentally switching from one idea to the other one and tried to stick to the old idea even after being directly told that this idea is wrong?
* Comfort with pointer based loops and recursion. The good programmers stand up, write the answer on the board, sometimes adding a clever fillip (Ooh! Unicode compliant! Nice!), and it takes thirty seconds, and now I have to decide if they’re really good, so I bring out the big guns: recursion and pointers. The best programmers all have an easy aptitude for dealing with multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. In programming, that means specifically that they have no problem with recursion (which involves holding in your head multiple levels of the call stack at the same time) or complex pointer-based algorithms (where the address of an object is sort of like an abstract representation of the object itself).   Being able to reason recursively or inductively is important for many areas of computing, including using heirarchical data representations (e.g. XML), distributed computing, searching, and sorting.
