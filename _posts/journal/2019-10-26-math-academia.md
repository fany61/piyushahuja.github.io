excerpt: A flourishing life in Math academia is to my siren song, tempting and seductive but dangerous. It is a mirage, something that looks attractive from distance but which would probably would never arrive if I chase it.

A oft-repeated joke in the setting of afterlife is this: a deceased person is given a preliminary tour of Heaven and Hell. Life in heaven, at the outset, seems so-so, a bit boring, a little undramatic. Hell, against all your expectations, turns out to be the stuff of dreams: a place where gorgeous members of the opposite sex serve you strawberries and wine while you sunbathe on picturesque white beaches. The deceased is then given a choice as to where to spend the rest of his afterlife, and without a second thought, they choose Hell.  The next they know,  the person finds themselves shackled in chains, tortured in burning flames while demons mutilate their genitals with pitchforks.  Usually this is part of a bigger joke or moral lesson, but the micro-lesson is this: appearances are deceptive, and our choices in life have consequences.

I remind myself of this trope every time I feel the pull of the academia, which happens quite often. It happens whenever I read a profile of some successful mathematician (e.g. Maryam Mirzakhami), or watch a movie where mathematicians and scientists play an important role (Contact, A Beautiful Mind, Proof), or when I read an articles like this: [To Live Your Best Life, Do Mathematics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170202-math-and-the-best-life-francis-su-interview/) or this: [Why did Grigori Prelman refuse the Fields Medal](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Grigori-Perelman-refuse-the-Fields-Medal/answer/Roman-Andronov).  I am immediately filled with visions of a future where I am leading a life of the mind, pursuing ideas pure and noble and lofty, where I fill up whiteboards with equations and windows with scrawls, where the floor of my room is full of papers and scratchpads.

> "Mathematics as a pursuit is uniquely suited to the achievement of human flourishing, a concept the ancient Greeks called eudaimonia, or a life composed of all the highest goods. All five basic human desires that are met through the pursuit of mathematics: play, beauty, truth, justice and love."

But I am well aware that the vision of that life is a mirage.  One of the root causes of our suffering can arise from the mismatch between the ideas we chase in our heads, and the reality of lived experience. I like the idea of living a life pursing Math, but do I like the lived experience of it? Of struggling through research problems, of repeated failures and dead-ends, of facing the existential angst that would inevitably arise when I am not making progress, in work and in life?  

For a brief while a year ago, while preparing for job interviews,  I took up Maths once again and started working through some CS problems. Freed from any external pressure of exams or external motivation of grades, I found it to be a meditative experience, filled with purpose and fulfilment. Achieving clarity and understanding of an algorithm gave me a moral happiness that I realised I hadn’t experienced in a while, that I do not experience in any other activities. 

So maybe I would be fine with the math struggle. But that is only one of the parts of the equation. How about the rest: would I even get to do the Math, or would most of it spent applying for funding, correcting papers, supervising undergrads, and so on? would I be able to provide for others and my family? Could I find similar fulfilment in some other activity: for example, private math teaching or R&D work in a company? What are the opportunity costs? So I looked around the Internet for other people’s experiences with this, and here I have collated all the reasons why one should not go for academia:

* It's an escape from the responsbilities of adulthood

> The problem is that, as time advances and your priorities start changing (want a real life / job, date people who don't date people whose lives aren't together, etc.), reality starts to intrude. Many grad students have an unacknowledged Peter Pan complex.



* There's a lot of anxiety and self-doubt

> "You should expect to invest years of your life into making progress on some hard problem with little encouragement in the meantime, this takes a tremendous toll on the mind and not for someone who falls easy prey to self doubt."

* There's not much impact you have

> I started a Econ PhD but left soon after as I realized that much of the economic theory which is taught is not realistic and not even a good proxy for how economic systems work. Computer Science has allowed researchers to build much more realistic models using agent-based modeling. When looking for econ PhD programs, make sure this is something they will allow you to research. The best skills you can get out of most traditional Econ PhD programs are econometrics and programming skills. Outside of that it is pretty much a waste of time. Yes, you can probably get a job quickly, but you will spend a lot of the time learning none-applicable skills.

> I studied Finance but had a work study with an econ professor and was amazed at how much hand waving existed in their economic models. I felt like I was charting very simple things(gdp, oil prices, ect) and he would come up with his own suspect analysis off that limited info. The worst part was that this guy had had a high ranking position in the presidents cabinet!

>  "the very best possible outcome for your research is that someone at Google or Microsoft or Facebook reads one of your papers, gets inspired by it, and implements something like it internally. Chances are they will have to change your idea drastically to get it to actually work, and you'll never hear about it. And of course the amount of overhead and red tape (grant proposals, teaching, committee work, etc.) you have to do apart from the interesting technical work severely limits your ability to actually get to that point. At Google, I have a much more direct route from idea to execution to impact. I get to hack all day, working on problems that are orders of magnitude larger and more interesting than I can work on at any university. That is really hard to beat, and is worth more to me than having "Prof." in front of my name, or a big office, or even permanent employment. In many ways, working at Google is realizing the dream I've had of building big systems my entire career. "


* There's not much in the way of appreciation, recognition or external validation

>  "Sometimes even after you publish your top result that took a lot out of you, it may take many years before people appreciate, let alone understand, your work- the vast majority of papers are never going to be read."

>  "46% of papers will never be looked at outside of the authors, reviewers, and the editors. The articles are not only never downloaded, but the pages are never even loaded. ~half of all papers are effectively lecturing into the void.

> There is a huge degree of specialization within academia, making it difficult to communicate insights to colleagues outside your specialty.


* It’s a Sales Game

> "To compensate for this horrible feedback mechanism you need to basically play the popularity game and try to give many talks and talk up your result when you meet people, so there's a lot of salesmanship involved here as well."

* It’s a ruthless Publish-or-Perish culture

> The career path is so twisted you have to either be insanely good (at math and at managing time) or just hate yourself enough to sacrifice your best years working essentially in the metaphorical darkness well outside the spotlight and most likely alone and poorly paid.

> I dropped out of a top 10ish econ phd program.. "The risk of failure is low." Yeah right. Even his own statistics don't back that up. "which doesn't force me to work 80 hours a week" But if you're a tenure track professor, you most certainly still will be
> There seems to be a Lake Woebegone effect: Everyone thinks they're going to be above average.
> The publish or perish incentive system in academia means that people are often focused more on delivering publishables than intellectual exploration. Even if you personally resist this, people around you may not, and therefore you may not find much of a peer group for intellectual exploration.

* There's a lot of politics. Academic life doesn't take place in a vacuum- ergo there's a lot of politics and pettiness from your peers.

>   "When I was post-doc at a well-respected university, the Profs treated me with a combination with disrespect and contempt (when they were not outright ignoring me). I switched to industry; my pay went up 3X-fold, and my talented colleagues praised those problem-solving abilities that I developed over the course of my academic career. My advice to you; f*ck academia! Its a petty pointless prison where you’ll never do anything worthwhile. Switch to industry in order to work and projects that actually have some impact on the world. Only then will you be treated with respect."

* It's a lot of admin work

> Being a professor is not the job I thought it would be. There's a lot of overhead involved, and (at least for me) getting funding is a lot harder than it should be. Also, it's increasingly hard to do "big systems" work in an academic setting. Arguably the problems in industry are so much larger than what most academics can tackle.

* It’s Poorly Paid

> * I was a fully funded grad student at MIT. Worked at the mall on the weekends for fun money. Also did it to not be around grad students. Being poor sucks. I didn't feel good eating ramen and siting on IKEA furniture when my "dumber" friends mades hundreds of thousands of dollar every year.

> doing a PhD costs you a house." (In terms of the lost salary during the PhD years - these days it's probably more like several houses.)

> How long can you afford to work for $20-30,000 a year? Most people can’t for very long. What are your financial obligations? What are your financial goals? Who relies on you to make a living? Who else is contributing to the running of the household? For me, I thought a PhD was a path to a middle-class lifestyle. I wanted to live in a nice house, drive a reliable car, drink decent whiskey, eat fresh organic food, and travel. I did not get a PhD to worry about my finances, rent crappy apartments, drive a shitty car, and make $12.50 an hour as an adjunct. No, money does not buy happiness. But not having enough money isn’t the pathway to happiness either. In fact, more stress and anxiety and unhappiness comes from not having money. Don’t underestimate the importance of making a decent income. There are other things you can do that will allow you to live the life you want and make a comfortable salary. Go do those things instead.

* It would make you less employable

> Anecdotal evidence, but I found my MASc [1] to be a very hard sell for most employers. That is even if it was very applied, the goal at the end of my project was pretty much to have a good enough prototype to get funding for a startup [2]. One company thought it was interesting and made an offer, but I ended up accepting a second offer from another company, a position which had already been offered to me after undergrad.

> I look at my high school classmates who I know went on to get Phds. (Sample size of 8) All of them were among the smartest few percent in the class. Every success that they got through the end of undergrad was due to academic performance. But afterwards things slowed down. Only 2 of 8 stayed through to tenure. The two smartest got Phds in math and wound up in non-faculty positions. One other got a science industry job. One wound up at a hedge fund. And two teach high school. All things considered it's not a bad lot in life, but these were amongst the best and brightest of my peer group. Five of Seven would have been better served taking other paths to their end destinations.

> "going to grad school in the humanities is an idiotic life choice that will likely fuck up your life. Of the people I know who were my approximate peers, two live at home; one works at an Apple Store; another works in a preschool; another is teaching the SAT, LSAT, and the like for one of the big companies that pay $15 – $20 an hour for such work; and a couple are adjuncts. A few have short-term contracts. Only one or two have the tenure-track positions they were training for."
