“Your parents (and guardians) are often piloted by the blind forces of trauma patterns. What they do at these times is not parenting but seizures of madness, of which you are the audience and often the victim. This is not your fault, not your doing, and is not right. You are good to the core, but happen to be on the receiving end of these seizures.  This is true for every occurrence of unkindness, humiliation, or abusive interaction by a person who has power over you. “


Sometimes it’s helpful to see beliefs, stereotypes, even language and habitual ways of thinking as forces that have colonized humanity. 


Every one is human, and humans are flawed, and our condition is tragic.
