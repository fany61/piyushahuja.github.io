excerpt: Things I want to pursue this year
permalink: /desires

First and foremost (and this is my most important long-term desire), I want to write a novel. A good novel. Why, even a great novel. I feel, perhaps foolishly, that I have a unique view of the world, that I can see truths others don’t see, that I have ideas, good ideas, which few others, if any, would have. It would be a pity to leave this world without having left my imprint, without having revealed or exposed the truths I see, or let the ideas I have influence the way the world I leave behind. Actually, this is what all art is all about, and although this desire to give a form to your ideas can be satisfied through music or movies or paintings and many other outlets, writing is the one which I have a strong *feel* for. I remember, as a kid, sitting on the ground on the second floor of Sector 6 house, writing on an A4 sheet the story of my day; I remember spending a summer vacation filling a whole notebook with a fictional story about space villains, such as those found in *Captain Vyom*; I remember reciting ‘*Veer Jawan, Tujhe Salam*’, my surprisingly-good-in-hindsight poem, to the injured army men from Kargil in the Command Hospital (Little Angels), and writing even more terrible poems for my creative writing class (Bhawan Vidyalaya) and the school magazine (St. John’s). Writing, in short, is something which I have always had an desire for - it goes back as far as I can remember, so this is a desire unadulterated by any want of wealth, fame or power - I pursued it for it’s own sake. And so I want to read great literature and good writers - DFW, Borges, Zadie Smith, Stephen Fry, Poe, Wilde and Wodehouse. I want to write with style, vigour and vibrancy. I want to write with humour. And I want to convert all the seemingly good ideas I have to words, every day, every time.

Second, I want to be muscular, strong and physically attractive. I want to flick heavy suitcases on my arms as if they were pillows. I want to have such a well toned body that I don’t have to worry about my (rather non-existent) dressing sense. I want to look like Vin Diesel or Bruce Willis, not like a short middle aged bald man with a potbelly. I want to workout, swim and row.

Third, I want to develop a wicked wit and a spontaneous sense of humour. A sense of humour which is intelligent, that neither deprecates the self nor offends the other. I would like to tease my friends about all the little idiosyncracies, contradictions, and stock character-like behavior that they exhibit. I want to poke fun at the absurdity of being human.

Fourth, I want to be skilled in my craft. Specifically, I want to be proficient at writing good, clean, and useful code. More generally, I want to have elaborate views on economic policies, backed by data and history. I want to be able to persuasively debate and argue on any question within the ambit of ethics and politics (or maybe even beyond).


Fifth, I want to be be on top of practical life-saving skills, a la Bear Grylls. None of the above skills are going to help me during a Zombie Apocalype, so to speak. So for starters, I want to know how to drive well in unwelcoming terrains, fix cars and bicycles, start and sustain a fire, and cook a good meal. I want to be extremely good at administering emergency medical aid, or treating anyone who is sick. I would also like to have have a working knowledge of plants and herbs in the wild, and know how to treat animals well.
