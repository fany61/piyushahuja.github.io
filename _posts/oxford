OXFORD




In my one year here, I’ve socialised and travelled extensively. I’ve enjoyed productive, thought-provoking conversations, every single day, over dinner table, in society gatherings or elsewhere. I’ve gone on hiking, camping and road trips. And I’ve learnt myriad other little things along the way.

 Deliberative Debates in JCR.

Personal growth: Why I think the way I do, How I think, what I value and what not, where my talents lie much more aware of that (Surrounded by diversity and folks that are always challenging you, intellectually)

Interesting Philosophical Questions studied:

What is freedom? 
What is the liberal conception of the good life?  
What is authority?  How different societies in history solve the problem of authority: Greek, Roman, etc.? What is the distinction between totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and dictatorship, between power and authority?
What counts as a nation? Evolution of nationalism and its different models -  latin american, state enforced, colonial. 
What is justice? Do we owe duties to our fellow citizens which we do not to the rest of the world? 
Why reduce economic inequality? 
Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem: The proofs themselves and their impact, particularly on Hilbert’s program. 
Logicism: Is Maths just logic?

Community is not about homogeneity of backgrounds, or views, or even values.  Community is about mutual respect, its about empathy, its about giving. Vasudeva Kutumbaka.
