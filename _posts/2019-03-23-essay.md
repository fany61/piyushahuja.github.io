**Oxford Tutorial Essay**

> Comrades, I promised some people that I would send out an email with advice on how to structure an essay, so here's a great little guide I've borrowed from one of my tutors. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

- B.1 Introduction: 

    A tutorial essay provides an answer to a question provided in the tutorial topics outlined above. It must include an introductory paragraph in which you outline the question, touch upon the societal and scientific relevance of this question, concisely define key concepts and briefly summarise the answer which you will give to it. Please keep your introduction short.


- B.2 Argumentation: 

    The main body of the essay provides the argumentation you develop in support of your answer to the overall research question. It is important that you here answer the question itself: an essay is not a general discussion on a broad topic; it is an answer to a specific question. So, for example, if you are asked the question “Is economic growth a prerequisite for the development of a democratic political system?”, you cannot write a general discussion on democracy. You have to tackle this particular question. Accordingly, you must ensure, when writing the essay, that every single sentence and paragraph is directed to, and useful for, providing this particular answer.


    In developing your answer, please provide several arguments that support it whilst also engaging with possible counter-arguments. It is thus important that the main body of your essay reflects the key debates within the field that you are writing about (i.e. in case of the question highlighted in the previous paragraph the study of democratisation). There are various ways of structuring this. A fairly standard one (and relatively safe!) is to make your case for a particular answer (X) and then examine and reject objections to X. Or vice versa.


    One of the most common criticisms which essays elicit is ‘asserts rather than argues its points.’ It is one thing to say X; it is quite another to provide a justification for X. In an academic essay, you are asked to do the latter. One way of providing justification for the theoretical arguments you present is by backing these up with empirical examples. However, make sure that you do not engage with evidence in a merely anecdotal manner. For instance, in the example discussed above about economic growth and democracy an argument against a potential relationship between the two may be that it is not economic growth per se that leads to democratisation, but rather an egalitarian distribution of increasing economic wealth. A possible empirical example that could underline this point could be the fact that in many countries of the Middle East high levels of economic growth (mainly through oil revenues) have not led to the development of democratic political systems. This authors argue is mainly due to wealth has not trickled down to the middle class in society which in turn have not out forward demands for more political input. Providing this piece of empirical evidence is much more instructive than simply describing the situation in Libya under Gaddafi’s rule.


- B.3 Conclusion: 

    You should finish the essay with a concluding paragraph which summarises the main findings, and, if appropriate, opens up the debate (e.g. by mentioning other issues which are relevant and interesting but which constitutes further avenues of inquiry). It is important that your conclusion entails the answer to the question posed. The Best Conclusions Relate to the Introduction. Introduction should be interesting. Please keep your conclusion short.

**Nietzsche's Toward the Teaching of Style**

> This is from a letter that Nietzsche wrote to Lou Salomé when she was beginning to write philosophy, and appears in her book on his work.



* Of prime necessity is life: a style should live.
* Style should be suited to the specific person with whom you wish to communicate. (The law of mutual relation.)
* First, one must determine precisely "what-and-what do I wish to say and present," before you may write. Writing must be mimicry.
* Since the writer lacks many of the speaker's means, he must in general have for his model a very expressive kind of presentation; of necessity, the written copy will appear much paler.
* The richness of life reveals itself through a richness of gestures. One must learn to feel everything--the length and retarding of sentences, interpunctuation, the choice of words, the pausing, the sequence of arguments--like gestures.
* Be careful with periods! Only those people who also have long duration of breath while speaking are entitled to periods. With most people, the period is a matter of affectation.
* Style ought to prove that one believes in an idea; not only thinks it but also feels it.
* The more abstract a truth one wishes to teach, the more one must first entice the senses.
* Strategy on the part of the good writer of prose consists of choosing his means for stepping close to poetry but never stepping into it.
* It is not good manners or clever to deprive one's readers of the most obvious objections. It is very good manners and very clever to leave it to one's readers alone to prononce the ultimate quintessence of our wisdom.
