excerpt: First Year Verdict

---

*I must preface this entry by a disclaimer. I’ve been told often by people whose judgements I trust that I suffer from an affliction, an affliction which has irrevocably warped my view of the world. The affliction is this: I only see the good in people, events, and, by extension, places. I beg to differ, but I would admit this: Oxford is very different to different people, and what I present here might be the complete opposite of someone else’s view. Yet we must also keep in mind that how we construct meaning from experience is partly a choice, and maybe this is how I’ve chosen to experience it.*

I wake up from a dream, not quite abruptly but in a slow transition.  My eyes, still a little groggy, are drawn naturally towards the daylight peering in through the window. The window looks less like a window but more like a painting on medieval architecture: arched windows and towers, domes and spires. The sky is grey though; the clouds moving in a rocketing speed like in a film put in fast motion. It cannot be seen from inside the room, but a blue plaque outside my house, in a clever self reference to Berkeley, reads "George Berkeley was *perceived* to have lived here circa something something”. Back in my room, my shelves are lined with the original works of Hume, Mill, Kant, Nagel, Quine, Russell and Putnam, and papers by Krugman, Friedman, Stiglitz and Coase. Most read, some unread. I check the time: still an hour to go before breakfast. It's Tuesday, and that means sausages, eggs and bacon, croissants and pain-aux-chocolats, cereal, milk, and fruit juices. I take a quick shower, put on Bach's Cello Suites, and just lie down on my bed. And at this moment,  there is only one question which is lingering in my ahead:

"How in the world did I end up here?"

The Oxford life is so different from any life that I've ever known, that I might as well have not woken up, and all this might as well have been a dream.

But to be serious, it has been a very enriching experience - both academically and culturally. 

While my education at IIT Delhi had provided me with strongly sciency, engineering-heavy technical foundations,  reading PPE at Oxford has given me a macro-perspective on the workings of the world, a perspective informed by philosophical, economical and policy considerations.  Not only the content, but also the unique learning process, the method, the style of education has allowed me to stretch intellectually in ways I didn’t think were possible.  

Oxford has what is called the tutorial system, which means that primary learning takes place in weekly one-on-one discussions with tutors in their private study where essays and doubts are discussed. What this essentially means is that as students here we are treated as equals, and get invaluable personal attention and customised feedback on our work by some of the world leaders in the field.

The socratic method-like approach of the tutorial system is a totally different ball game from the class room based, top-down, didactic method of instruction at IIT Delhi, and it has manifoldly improved both my presentation and communication.  I’ve switched from puzzles with fixed answers to open-ended essays, from programming to writing, from problem solving to argumentation, from slow, long drawn out research to assessing an argument quickly and thinking critically on your feet, from depth to breadth.  

Culturally, there is a distinctive Oxford way of life. Wearing gowns and ‘subfusc’. Speaking with a cultish vocabulary (*‘Scouts’ ‘Bursary’ ‘Michaelmas/Hilary/Trinity’, ‘Battels’, ‘Dons’, ‘Blue’, ‘Pidge’, ‘Porter’*). Attending classical music concerts and going to the theatre. Free flowing Wine at every possible opportunity (My college even has a *Wine Appreciation Society*, which yours truly is a member of, obviously). From Croquet and Rowing to Pimms and Punting, from Formal Halls and Garden Parties to Bops and Barbeque, the Oxford life is quite the experience even to my British friends. 

But despite its unique culture (steeped in a rich history and the ancient (British) tradition no doubt), Oxford is a truly global city, and while here you are truly a global citizen. At Oxford you meet people from from all kinds of cultures, all international backgrounds, all ages and ethnicities, pursuing every possible intellectual or extra curricular interests you can think of. It is cosmopolitan in the true sense, and the exposure one gets here is unparalleled.[^friends]

[^friends]: I now have good friends from all over the world. Lebanon, Palestine, Puerto Rico, Germany, England, Mexico, Singapore, USA, Slovakia, France, Canada, Scotland, Russia, Switzerland, Denmark. Probably a couple dozen more if I were to include mere acquaintances.


The global culture has contributed tremendously to my personal growth.  Religion, region or race has never been central to my identity: I have always seen myself as a citizen of the world. As such, Oxford has helped me anchor my identity, and so it is almost like a second home.  For the first time I’ve gotten to really know the customs, cuisines, dances, and politics ofso many different countries.[^cosmopolitan] With the benefit of an outside view, that I have developed a complete perspective of Indian and Western cultures, their points of similarity and contrast. And I can now see how different cultures evolve under differing traditions, laws and institutions.[^institutions]

[^institutions]: Healthcare, Traffic Laws, Extractive Economics, Arranged Marriage and Divorce and How People Look and Prisoner's Dilemma, 


[^cosmopolitan]: Did you know, for example, that although Puerto Rico is part of US, it doesn’t belong to the US? That in Denmark you get paid to attend college (which people stretch to the age of 26 or so)?.  That in Germany you can sue your parents if they refuse to pay for your maintenance during your first college degree? That Switzerland and South Korea, just like Israel and Singapore, have compulsory military service for its citizens? I’ve learnt about the unique political arrangement by which Lebanon manages to band together a society with ever deepening sectarian divide. I’ve heard personal accounts of friends from both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I’ve danced in Scottish Ceilidhs and Salsa classes, learnt Arabic greetings and Spanish pick-up lines.

Sports and studies, arts and academics go side by side in Oxford. People here are extremely well rounded: academically bright, physically fit, creative, witty and always politically correct (sometimes  annoyingly so). Importantly, the community in Oxford believes in excellence. Whatever they pursue, they strive for excellence. Aristotle had once said that mankind’s ultimate purpose, and our ultimate happiness, lies in *arete*, that is, the pursuit of excellence. People in Oxford pursue this idea of excellence, excellence not as an act but as a habit, as *a way of life*, and just being part of this culture is incredibly rewarding in itself. 

It was my first ever extended stay abroad when I came here. There was something to be learnt not just from new academic and cosmopolitan environment, but also from the cultural adjustments I had to make. For starters, there were new dress codes to adhere to.[^subfusc] There were language barriers. Actually more like accent barriers (*“Sorry, could you repeat that?”*). I am still getting accustomed to the western culture of individualism,[^individualism] the [different standards of punctuality](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-different-cultures-understand-time-2014-5?IR=T) (an old joke is that in the western world time is seen as a particular point in space, while in India and east Asian cultures it is seen more as a spectrum), the laws of the new land,[^laws] the (insane-by-any-standards) drinking culture,[^driking] a complete change from a vegetarian to a meat heavy diet, and many other small nuanced things (like addressing professors by their first names) which I cannot even begin to list. 

[^individualism]: At IIT Delhi, sharing notes and studying in groups was the norm.Here, it's to each its own.

[^subfusc]: What exactly is a *subfusc* and when are we supposed to wear one? What goes and what doesn't in black tie and white tie events? What about garden parties?

[^laws]: In India, traffic etiquette  is governed by a concern for other traffic, rickshaws, two wheelers, three wheelers, pedestrians, cows and dogs, as opposed to pedantic rule-following which is the case here.  So lots of honking, and “[walking like a cow](http://www.economist.com/whichmba/mba-diary-walk-cow),” as one writer puts it.

[^driking]: Far from having a bar in the college itself or free flowing wine in academic events, in India drinking something even remotely alcoholic is frowned upon, an activity for the rowdy, uncivilised and uneducated. 

It’s all part of the learning process, and I’ve tremendously enjoyed the experince. I’ve socialised and travelled extensively.  I’ve enjoyed having productive, thought-provoking conversations, every single day, over dinner table, in society gatherings or elsewhere, with some of the people who (I can tell) are headed for big things. I’ve gone on hiking, camping and road trips. And I’ve learnt myriad other little things along the way.[^learnt]

[^learnt]: Basic first aid, repairing bikes, setting up a barbecue, cooking a few Indian curries, spotting constellations in the night sky, and so on.

To put it succinctly, being a student at Oxford has broadened my mind, widened my horizons, and expanded my view of the world.

“There are few greater temptations on earth than to stay permanently at Oxford,” wrote Hilaire Belloc. Another friend’s love for the place finds expression in her worst fear: that the Oxford life is the peak, and everything after this could only possibly go downhill. 

As for me though, for now, I am just glad to be here.
