Deloitte

At Deloitte, I was on a data warehousing project in team of four. Specifically:

1. My role involved identifying requirements from end users, gathering hardware and software resources,  identifying data sources, and making a concrete project plan. 

2. I designed the architecture of a data warehouse prototype to be deployed for a clientâ€™s communication skills training programme. 

3. Our team also made a report generation tool,  thus enabling strategic decision making for senior management.
