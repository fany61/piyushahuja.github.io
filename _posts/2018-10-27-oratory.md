Structure is important! 
to be able to explain something - which you have understood - eloquently and succinctly to someone, one just needs to start with a strategic framework in the mind, and a working understanding of how information can best be organised and structured in an explanation path.
From my own experience in coaching people, information can be best organised and structured as follows, from the explanatory standpoint:
- listing or enumeration;
- topical;
- definition;
- classification
- process;
- chronological;
- compare and contrast;
- order of importance;
- sequence;
- spatial;
- cause and effect;
- problem:solution

For example, when explaining something that is a listing or enumeration, the strategic framework one holds in the head is to use a numerical sequence to explain the information.
If it's a process that you are explaining, you know very well that a process always involves stages or steps, in a sequence.
That's to say, there's a start-point, an end-point, and a developmental path of transition points in between.
With such a strategic framework in the mind, your explanatory path just follows the sequence.

No response from joke? Don’t apologise, carry on, don’t bring attention to the fact
Manage Anxiety by recognising it
Use conversational language (not defensive or high status!)
See things as an opportunity, rather than as an adversarial situation!

* Wherever your company lands on this sliding scale, one thing will always remain true: *you have to be able to sell your product or service.* If you don’t sell it, no one else will. You team is relying on you to explain the benefits of the company and how it’s changing the world. It’s your job as the founder to communicate that vision. And realistically, you may not have a company for long if you can’t sell. Because it’s not just about doing interviews with journalists or sitting on panels. You have to pitch your idea to VCs if you really want a shot at building your startup into a lasting business. Personally, speaking in front of people was not one of my best traits when starting ThirdLove five years ago. But I’ve spoken at hundreds of interviews, panels, and events since then. Over time, I’ve gotten much better at it. Here’s what I learned along the way: 
    * *Practice with people you feel comfortable with.*
        It’s much easier to start practicing in front of people you know. They’ll be more forgiving when you make a mistake. And hopefully, you can solicit real feedback from them about what you need to work on. You can even do this internally at your company by giving updates or announcements to a small group of people. As you get more comfortable, increase the size of the group. If you want to practice pitching a potential investor, use your network to find another founder or an unrelated investor who’s willing to listen. The goal is to find someone who can give you candid feedback about your pitch and help you improve. For me, the most difficult part of selling my vision in the beginning was the fact that it was just a concept. I didn’t have something tangible to really help me capture that vision and communicate it the way I wanted to. But once your idea becomes a reality and you have a real product, talking about your company becomes much easier. 
    * *Focus on one point.*
        I learned this the hard way. When we launched ThirdLove in 2013, our executive team was three people: my co-founder Dave, our Chief Creative Officer, Ra’el, and me. We drove around San Francisco, meeting with different reporters to do interviews about our seed round and launch. 
        None of us had done these types of interviews before. And we quickly realized we had too many people in the room. The three of us were speaking in different styles and presenting an overwhelming amount of information. Each article reflected a different angle because we were inundating the reporters with too many talking points. 
        That experience taught me an important lesson: When announcing news to the press, you should always make it about one thing. Pick one point you want to get across and stick to that core story. It’s fine to use supporting points, but keep the focus on the idea you want to see in print. 
   
    * *Know you can’t predict everything.*
        You won’t be able to plan for everything that happens in an interview or a conference room. So that means you have to get used to dealing with the unknown. 
        If you’re asked a question you’re not prepared for, don’t scramble just to come up with a quick answer. It doesn’t matter whether you’re sitting across from a journalist or a VC—just tell them you don’t know. 
        You can say, “That’s a great question. Let me have my team pull that data and get back to you.” 
        Easy as that. Now you have time to make sure your answer is correct, as well as to reflect on how you want to answer the question later on. 
        My last piece of advice is simple: Remember, you’re the expert on this subject. 
        You started this company for a reason, and you know how you’re delivering value. Don’t lose sight of the fact that you know your business better than anyone. Keep that in mind, and you’ll have all the confidence you need stepping into the spotlight.

What am I trying to accomplish?


1. Care!
2. Be Authoritative,Loud, Continued Annotation/Commentary
3. Include Mistakes?
4. Utterly Prepared

What is ( a sad state of affairs), What could be (A vision), What is (show how horrible the current state is) , What could be (Marvel at what all could be). End with A call to action. Use Metaphors, Imagery, Repetition. 


* When presenting, select the single most important idea and present it crystal clear, in one sentence. It should have three supporting points, because we think in triads.
* Each point should open with stories, metaphors, analogies, numbers, and statistics that your audience can relate to. Close with a clear point or a transition to the step you want the audience to take.
* Audiences remember beginnings and endings, so don't end with a Q&A. Let the audience ask questions during the presentation; this increases their participation and energy level.
* When crafting your sentences, use the word you as often as possible, create sensory-rich graphics, beware negations, and keep them short.
* Avoid irritants, or sounds or movements that do not add to your message. Every one of them is a form of communication that demands a portion of your audience's attention.
* To project power and own the stage, adopt a wide stance, practice without a podium or lectern, and find the right volume to project confidence.
* To project warmth, speak as if you were sharing a secret, and give one or two seconds of eye contact per person as you roam the stage.
* Pause frequently and deliberately. Have the confidence to make your listeners wait for your words. Also pause for three seconds after you first walk on stage, while sweeping your eyes across the audience.
* If you make a mistake, tell yourself that moguls and entertainers do this to make themselves more relatable. De-stigmatize and de-dramatize.
* Make a speech all about your audience. This takes the focus off yourself, lifts your self-consciousness, and puts you into a state of goodwill.
* 

Get Feedback
 the problem is worthwhile (it is a real problem, and a solution would be useful)
the problem it is hard (not already solved, and there are not other ways to achieve equally good results)
that you have solved it- or made progress,So be sure to provide motivation for your work, provide background about the problem, and supply sufficient technical details and experimental results.
often intuitions and an explanation of the approach are more valuable than the gory details of a proof

What's the problem? Who cares? What's your solution? 

PGP: with every subtopic, move from the Particular to the General and back to the Particular. Even though the purpose of a subtopic is to convey the general information, bracing it with particulars is a good way to draw attention and promote retention.

Dont underestimate intelligence.
What will people feel as a result of hearing my presentation?
Tell the purpose and plan, what I expect of them to do during and after
Additional support materials


Must know of the structure from the start - they cannot go back and forth like the reader of a text

1. Identitfy your system
2. The features that differentiate from other systems

Relevant to a listener's interest and needs
Build around your listener's interests

State your theme and message at the beginning

As you will know from the subject ...... insert additional material for the purpose of others who might be present.



How to Give a Good Conference Talk

By Deane Barker on April 17, 2014


I talk at a fair amount of conferences. Over the years, I’ve taken notes on how to do it well (this pre-supposes that I do it well, which is very much up for debate).  I figured I’d share these notes.
Now, understand that I give a very specific type of conference presentation, which is 30-50 minutes and always based around a presentation deck (a Power Point).  This might not fit for everyone.  Some of you might be doing a short speech unsupported by any visuals. If so, pick and choose from the sections below.
Also, I don’t offer this list as hard-and-fast rules, nor do I think it’s the only way to do it. This is simply what works for me. I concede that other people may have entirely different ways of doing it.
Here are my notes, edited slightly to make for a better blog post. If you’re staring down a conference presentation, I hope they help you.  (And, in the true spirit of PowerPoint, these are in the form of bullet points, because that’s how I wrote them down originally.)
Questions to Ask the Organizers

The answers to these questions will help you, either explicitly or implicitly. The idea here is that it’s good to get as much background info as you can, because whether you’re aware of it or not, it will influence your talk as you put it together.
* How long do you have to speak?
* Do they expect a Q & A period?
* Where is the venue? What is its layout?  A theater?  A classroom?  A conference room? (If you can visit the venue beforehand, or see pictures of it, do that. It really helps to be able to visualize the room when you’re rehearsing. Things that might work in one type of room will fail completely in another.)
* Can you have a deck?
* How many people are in attendance?
* What events are before and after your talk?  Another talk?  Which one?  Food?  Going home?
* What is the audience members’ relationship to the topic?  How knowledgeable are they?  Are they seasoned conference attendees, or is this rare for them?
* Have they paid money to be there?
* What is their expectation of learning?  What do they hope to come away with?
* How is your talk being advertised or promoted?  What is the organizer promising – implicitly or explicitly – to attendees?
* What is the tone of the talk?
    * Tutorial: insert tab X into slot Y
    * Informational: this is information about topic X you might not know
    * Conceptual: this is a new way of looking at or thinking about X
    * Narrative/case study: this is something we did in situation X
* What is the scope of what you want them to learn?  Are you trying to teach them something incremental, or something revolutionary?  Do you want then to nod their heads and say “that’s some useful information I can use,” or are you shooting for “wow, that was mind-blowing!”  The latter is riskier – it’s awesome when it works, a disaster when it doesn’t.
* What is the point of your deck?  Is it the focus of your talk — screencaps or something you will be talking about directly, or is it decoration and mood-setting?
* What are the technical parameters?  Will you be able to use your own laptop?  How big is the screen?  Will you have a monitor where you can see your deck as you’re giving it? Will you have a remote mouse (hint: bring your own).
Planning Your Talk

* Start early. I know you don’t want to – it’s so much easier to avoid doing it because it can be scary and actually doing it brings you face-to-face with that fear. But the fear isn’t going to go away, it’s just going to get worse with time, so face up to it early.
* Give yourself enough prep time. The rule of thumb is that you need one hour of prep for every minute of presentation time.  So a 50-minute talk will take over a full-time week of work to put together. This, of course, varies greatly, and you may have a full-fleshed out talk in your head, ready-to-go.  But, in general, understand that it’s going to take more time than you think it will.
* Write down, in a couple bullet points, the things you want the audience members to come away with. In a perfect world, this is what they learned – this is the future state you want them to get to. These points will guide you while putting together the entire thing. You can “test” your talk against these points.
* Write down the major talking points to support those learning points and put them in order – “to tell this story, I need to talk about X, then Y, then Z.” This divides your talk up into sections, which is important. Talks need to progress like a story – there needs to be a build-up, a center section, then a conclusion. A movie separates these with “plot points.”  You don’t have plot points; you have section transitions.
* Incrementally embellish each section. Treat it as a mini-talk by itself – “to tell this story (section), I need to talk about X, then Y, then Z.”
* Don’t edit too much when putting this together.  Go nuts. Pretend you have all the time in the world and make it as long as you want.  Rehearsal is when you start cutting the thing down, and it’s better to start with too much information than too little.
* Don’t be surprised if the content of your talk changes considerably through this process.  Not only the specifics, but the entire nature and message. This sounds weird, but as you say things out loud and create slides to illustrate it, this has a way of catalyzing things in your own head. You don’t truly understand something until you have to explain it, and the process of explaining it will often make you think differently about it. (See “Rubber Duck Debugging.”)  There have been several times when I was mid-way through rehearsals and suddenly realized, “I’ve been thinking about this all wrong…” or “My main point is not that important after all. Rather, this smaller point is really want I should be teaching them…” If this happens, don’t be scared – it’s a gift.
Preparing Your Deck

* Transfer your outline to PowerPoint, or whatever.  Most all of my talks are very presentation-based, which I realize isn’t true for everyone.  But when I’m prepping a deck, I put my outline in Power Point, then start developing there.
* For goodness sakes, understand how the software works.  If you’re using PowerPoint, get a book and do some remedial PowerPoint training.  This is stressful enough — don’t make it worse by not understanding what you’re doing.
* A practical note: put the file in Dropbox immediately.  You don’t want to lose it, and if someone goes wrong, you can retrieve it from Dropbox from any computer. There are several times when I’ve had to download a deck from Dropbox onto the presentation computer at the last minute. (Once, in Lisbon, I actually made a change 15 seconds before I went on, hoping that it replicated fast enough to beat me to the podium. It did.)
* Do your title slide and your transitional slides right away, so you have a framework of the talk to work with. You have your sections set now, so you can concentrate on supporting them individually and telling the story around the transitions between sections.  Also do the last slide — it should always be your contact information. So you should have the beginning, section headings, and final slide done first, which gives you a framework to embellish.
* Don’t worry about design too much.  If your slides need a theme, and if you know how to work your presentation software, you can apply it towards the end. (The current trend is away from design – the plainer the better these days, it seems.)
* Do not pay attention to any guidelines about how long to talk over a slide. I’ve spent five minutes talking about a slide. I’ve also spent five seconds. I’ll often have a sequence of five slides that I rip through in 15 seconds. It’s not important – your talk matters more than the slides. They are there to support what you’re saying.
Rehearsing Your Talk

* Rehearse out loud, by yourself, to an empty room.  Yes, you’ll feel stupid.  Tough — better to feel stupid by yourself than in front of a group.
* Rehearse the entire talk at least 10 times. Yes, that is a lot.
* Get a remote clicker.  Walk around.  Gesture.  If your dog doesn’t look at you funny at least once every rehearsal, you’re not moving enough.
* Rehearsals have two different flavors:
    * Exploratory: this is a loose run through, when you stop and adjust slides, change things, etc.  You can stop in the middle and edit.
    * For Time: keep going through, no matter what.  This is how you’re going to determine if you’re within the time boundaries.
* Don’t always rehearse from the beginning.  The goal is to be able to pick up at at any point in the talk and carry through to the finish.  So, in addition to doing the entire thing, start ¼ of the way through, ½ of the way through, right at the end, pick a random slide and start from there, etc.  If you start from the beginning all the time, then the beginning gets a lot of focus, and the latter part of the talk doesn’t get your full rehearsal attention.
* Try to get Presenter View (a PowerPoint thing; Keynote probably has something similar) — you should be able to see the upcoming slide on a separate monitor at all times, with your notes if possible.  If not, print the presentation notes out before hand. (Though, honestly, if you have to refer to your notes at all, you probably didn’t rehearse enough.)
* If a slide doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.  If you’re tripping over a slide, and it just doesn’t sound right, get rid of it — either drop it, or combine it with something else.  So long as you have enough time before you have to talk, don’t be afraid to do major surgery.  Slides that sound wrong, probably are wrong.
* If you’re using notes, don’t write them as if you’re going to read them verbatim.  Write bullet points that will just jar your memory of the points you need to cover.
* Concentrate on your last section. This is the payoff, and too many times, people rehearse solely from the beginning so by the last section, they’re just trying to get done. Rehearse the last section by itself multiple times.
Giving The Actual Talk

* Show up early, and make sure AV is fine.  Get your presentation up on the screen before anyone shows up, and run through it quickly to make sure it looks right.  You do not want surprises (“Where is my custom font?!?!”) right before you talk.
* Have a remote clicker.  Always.  Podiums suck.
* The goal is to have the talk feel conversational, not formal.  Meet as many people as you can before the talk.  As the room fills up, go introduce yourself and talk to people.  Your goal is to make them feel that they’re in this talk with you, not that you’re giving it and they’re receiving it (even though that’s exactly what’s happening).
* If you can, start with some comment about the event or something that just occurred: “I was just talking to Mark in the hall…” This sets people at ease and takes you immediately off-script, so it sets expectations on the conversational tone of what follows.
* Don’t read from the presentation.  This sucks for a lot of reasons, but mainly because you’re setting yourself up to be super-rehearsed, and if you have to ad lib, it becomes totally obvious that you’re off-script.  You should sound off-script all the time.
* Be explicit about the section transitions.  “Okay, so I’ve just explained what X was, now I’m going to talk about why X is important.”  The audience wants this – they want to know that they’re moving steadily through the talk. They want to mentally organize the content: “What did I learn in that last section? I need to store that away, because this is a new section with a new thing to learn.”
* Try not to be nervous.  I know this sounds like a ridiculous platitude, but here’s why it’s important: if you’re nervous, the audience will be nervous too. They’ll be scared for you, and they’ll subconsciously resent you for it.  If you’re relaxed and having a good time, the audience will be too.  Remember this: they want to like you. They do not want to see you fail. If you make them feel awkward, it’s harder for them to like you.
* If you think of an anecdote, tell it. Remember, you’re not on a strict script here. Feel free to weave in and out of your rehearsed outline. I don’t think I’ve gotten through a single talk where I didn’t extemporaneously say something that I never rehearsed.
* Gesture at the screen.  Point at stuff, if appropriate.  Look at the screen yourself.  You want the audience to feel like this is something you’re looking at together, not that it’s just background information.
* Last slide is contact information.  Invite people to contact you with questions, or if they want to talk about anything you presented. It has practical value, and it’s a nice, clear way to signal that the talk is done. The audience wants to know when to clap, and they’ll feel comfortable with an explicit cue.
If you want some more good tips, take a look at this: 11 Top Tips for a Successful Technical Presentation. In particular, read the comments there – lots of great stuff submitted in the comments. It’s also worth noting that Scott Hanselman is the presenting style that I really try to emulate: he’s so wonderfully relaxed when he talks that you feel like you’re in it with him, rather than being lectured to.
If I could replicate one talk (in vibe and style, not so much content), it would be this one: It’s not what you read, it’s what you ignore. That’s Scott at WebStock 2012 in New Zealand. It’s fantastic.
It helps that Scott has spoken at my company, sitting at my breakroom table. It’s easy to like someone when they do that for you.
