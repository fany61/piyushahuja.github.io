Structure is important! 
to be able to explain something - which you have understood - eloquently and succinctly to someone, one just needs to start with a strategic framework in the mind, and a working understanding of how information can best be organised and structured in an explanation path.
From my own experience in coaching people, information can be best organised and structured as follows, from the explanatory standpoint:
- listing or enumeration;
- topical;
- definition;
- classification
- process;
- chronological;
- compare and contrast;
- order of importance;
- sequence;
- spatial;
- cause and effect;
- problem:solution

For example, when explaining something that is a listing or enumeration, the strategic framework one holds in the head is to use a numerical sequence to explain the information.
If it's a process that you are explaining, you know very well that a process always involves stages or steps, in a sequence.
That's to say, there's a start-point, an end-point, and a developmental path of transition points in between.
With such a strategic framework in the mind, your explanatory path just follows the sequence.

* Wherever your company lands on this sliding scale, one thing will always remain true: *you have to be able to sell your product or service.* If you don’t sell it, no one else will. You team is relying on you to explain the benefits of the company and how it’s changing the world. It’s your job as the founder to communicate that vision. And realistically, you may not have a company for long if you can’t sell. Because it’s not just about doing interviews with journalists or sitting on panels. You have to pitch your idea to VCs if you really want a shot at building your startup into a lasting business. Personally, speaking in front of people was not one of my best traits when starting ThirdLove five years ago. But I’ve spoken at hundreds of interviews, panels, and events since then. Over time, I’ve gotten much better at it. Here’s what I learned along the way: 
    * *Practice with people you feel comfortable with.*
        It’s much easier to start practicing in front of people you know. They’ll be more forgiving when you make a mistake. And hopefully, you can solicit real feedback from them about what you need to work on. You can even do this internally at your company by giving updates or announcements to a small group of people. As you get more comfortable, increase the size of the group. If you want to practice pitching a potential investor, use your network to find another founder or an unrelated investor who’s willing to listen. The goal is to find someone who can give you candid feedback about your pitch and help you improve. For me, the most difficult part of selling my vision in the beginning was the fact that it was just a concept. I didn’t have something tangible to really help me capture that vision and communicate it the way I wanted to. But once your idea becomes a reality and you have a real product, talking about your company becomes much easier. 
    * *Focus on one point.*
        I learned this the hard way. When we launched ThirdLove in 2013, our executive team was three people: my co-founder Dave, our Chief Creative Officer, Ra’el, and me. We drove around San Francisco, meeting with different reporters to do interviews about our seed round and launch. 
        None of us had done these types of interviews before. And we quickly realized we had too many people in the room. The three of us were speaking in different styles and presenting an overwhelming amount of information. Each article reflected a different angle because we were inundating the reporters with too many talking points. 
        That experience taught me an important lesson: When announcing news to the press, you should always make it about one thing. Pick one point you want to get across and stick to that core story. It’s fine to use supporting points, but keep the focus on the idea you want to see in print. 
   
    * *Know you can’t predict everything.*
        You won’t be able to plan for everything that happens in an interview or a conference room. So that means you have to get used to dealing with the unknown. 
        If you’re asked a question you’re not prepared for, don’t scramble just to come up with a quick answer. It doesn’t matter whether you’re sitting across from a journalist or a VC—just tell them you don’t know. 
        You can say, “That’s a great question. Let me have my team pull that data and get back to you.” 
        Easy as that. Now you have time to make sure your answer is correct, as well as to reflect on how you want to answer the question later on. 
        My last piece of advice is simple: Remember, you’re the expert on this subject. 
        You started this company for a reason, and you know how you’re delivering value. Don’t lose sight of the fact that you know your business better than anyone. Keep that in mind, and you’ll have all the confidence you need stepping into the spotlight.
