Children dying - a few seconds can make a difference - Importance of rigorous collection of data, insights from data, patterns over long term, how to work in hostile environs - being personable , importance of teamwork

AIIMS project, collecting data, helping patients, fact based approach, rigorous data collection= gathered and analyzed, accuracy and filtering, understood the needs, inteviewed doctors, nurses, researched possible mathematical models or solutions, brainstormed, developed recommendations, worked intensively with the staff


If I run a monte carlo simulation, combine it with optimisation, even a few seconds saved in patient waiting time or increase in patient throughput could improve lives.



Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo methods (or Monte Carlo experiments) are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results; typically one runs simulations many times over in order to obtain the distribution of an unknown probabilistic entity.
