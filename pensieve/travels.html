There'd be a day when I sit down and reminisce all the amazing journeys I have been on -   the week-long road trip in Iceland, climbing Krakatoa in Indonesia, the two months in Singapore, the two weeks of trekking in Spiti valley, the royal treatment in Thailand, the cross-country India trip, and so on. That would be the day when I fill this page up.

      <div class = "postit">
        <a class="postit-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a> 
        <span class="post-tag">{{ post.tag}}</span>
      </div>
{% endfor %}
