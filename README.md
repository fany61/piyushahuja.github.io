This is Piyush's personal website. It uses the static site generator Jekylll to render markdown files into html. The inspiration for the design was Mark Reid's website,  and the basic layout was coded in HTML/CSS.

<!-- To do: 

- Modularize CSS
- Make the website reponsive
- Add features from: https://www.gwern.net/About#tools
