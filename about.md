I was born and brought up in Chandigarh, India, and have been educated at IIT Delhi and Oxford. 

I think a lot about the authenticity, identity, the possibility of communication, the problem of consciousness, philosophy of mathematics, and artistic expression. 

Among the artists I like are Hayao Miyazaki, David Foster Wallace, Wes Anderson and Radiolab the podcast. 

I am 26.
