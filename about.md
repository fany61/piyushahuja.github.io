I was born and brought up in Chandigarh, India, and have been educated at IIT Delhi and Oxford. 

I think a lot about mathematics, consciousness, learning,  authenticity, and artistic expression. 

Artists whose works I admire include Wes Anderson, Hayao Miyazaki, and David Foster Wallace. I also like listening to Radiolab, the podcast. 

I am 26.
