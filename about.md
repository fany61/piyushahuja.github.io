I was born and brought up in Chandigarh, India, and have been educated at IIT Delhi and Oxford. 

I think a lot about authenticity, identity, the possibility of communication, the problem of consciousness, philosophy of mathematics, learning, and artistic expression. 

Among the artists I like are Wes Anderson, Hayao Miyazaki, David Foster Wallace, and Radiolab (the podcast).

I am 26.
