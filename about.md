<!-- <img class='inset right' src='/1.jpg' title='Piyush Ahuja' width='100px'  />  -->

Hi, I am Piyush. I was born and brought up in Chandigarh, India, and have been educated at IIT Delhi and The University of Oxford. These are the places I consider home. 

I love helping, mentoring, or supporting others in their quest to improve the human condition. If that sounds like you, feel free to reach out to me at piyushahuja.in@gmail.com.

Some of causes that are close to my heart are: early stage interventions in education - especially philosophy and math, promoting philosophical and critical thinking in the general population, and improving the lives of the marginalised. 

I am currently building [Platonio.io](http://platonia.io) with the mission to turn every individual into a school in themselves. If you'd like to join us, drop me an email.   



This is a little corner of the Internet which I have claimed for myself. -->





<!--We are a family of four - Dad, the head of the house, Mother Mathematics and the two of us, the offsprings -  Philosophy and Economics. Dad is a lazy academic, while Mom is a working professional. She goes by the name of Computer Science in corporate circles, and is the best damn person in the whole world.

We also have a half-sister, Little Literature, who's a result of an adulterous affair Dad had with Lady Language in his IIT Delhi days. We had to move to Oxford after that, but Dad, being the man that he is, took responsibility for Little Literature and brough her along. Sometimes we feel that he loves her more than us. 

 Daen looks back at his days of youthful romanticism with a sort of wistful longing, the days when he and mother Mathematics first met, those days, the days of the chase, when he would sit in his room all day thinking about her, the days before the exams when her thoughts wouldnt let him sleep. d oft. Among other things, Dad likes the works of David Foster Wallace, Jorge Luis Borges, Wes Anderson, Hayao Miyazaki
