<!-- <img class='inset right' src='/1.jpg' title='Piyush Ahuja' width='100px'  />  -->

Hi, I am Piyush. I was born and brought up in Chandigarh, India, and have been educated at IIT Delhi and the University of Oxford. These places are like home to me. 

I am currently building [platonia.io](http://platonia.io). At the moment its just a small side project, but it has a lot of potential, me thinks.  If you'd like to contribute or know more, please drop me an email. 

I also love helping, mentoring, or supporting others in their quest to make a difference in the world. If that sounds like you, I'd love to hear from you!  I can be reached at piyushahuja.in@gmail.com.






<!--We are a family of four - Dad, the head of the house, Mother Mathematics and the two of us, the offsprings -  Philosophy and Economics. Dad is a lazy academic, while Mom is a working professional. She goes by the name of Computer Science in corporate circles, and is the best damn person in the whole world.

We also have a half-sister, Little Literature, who's a result of an adulterous affair Dad had with Lady Language in his IIT Delhi days. We had to move to Oxford after that, but Dad, being the man that he is, took responsibility for Little Literature and brough her along. Sometimes we feel that he loves her more than us. 

 Daen looks back at his days of youthful romanticism with a sort of wistful longing, the days when he and mother Mathematics first met, those days, the days of the chase, when he would sit in his room all day thinking about her, the days before the exams when her thoughts wouldnt let him sleep. d oft. Among other things, Dad likes the works of David Foster Wallace, Jorge Luis Borges, Wes Anderson, Hayao Miyazaki
