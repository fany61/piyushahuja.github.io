<img class='inset right' src='/1.jpg' title='Piyush Ahuja' width='170px'  /> 

I graduated from IIT Delhi in 2013 with a major in Mathematics and Computing. Prior to that, I was born and brought-up in Chandigarh, where I had my schooling at St. John's High.

I am currently reading for a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.
