<!-- <img class='inset right' src='/1.jpg' title='Piyush Ahuja' width='100px'  />  -->

Hi, I am Piyush. I was born and brought up in Chandigarh, India, and have been educated at IIT Delhi and the University of Oxford. These places are like home to me. 

I am currently building [platonia.io](http://platonia.io), a product which allows a learner to find students they can teach so they can better learn what they are learning themselves :)  If you'd like to contribute or pitch in, please drop me an email. 

I also love helping, mentoring, or supporting others in their quest to make a difference in the world. If that sounds like you, I'd love to hear from you!  I can be reached at piyushahuja.in@gmail.com.






<!--We are a family of four - Dad, the head of the house, Mother Mathematics and the two of us, the offsprings -  Philosophy and Economics. Dad is a lazy academic, while Mom is a working professional. She goes by the name of Computer Science in corporate circles, and is the best damn person in the whole world.

We also have a half-sister, Little Literature, who's a result of an adulterous affair Dad had with Lady Language in his IIT Delhi days. We had to move to Oxford after that, but Dad, being the man that he is, took responsibility for Little Literature and brough her along. Sometimes we feel that he loves her more than us.
