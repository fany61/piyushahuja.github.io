Update: I am relocating to Cambridge (UK) in July 2019. 

My long-term project, [Platonia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platonialabs.platonia) can now be downloaded on Google playstore.  


I graduated from [IIT Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Delhi) with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master's thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms for networks under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg). Here's a [link to my thesis][thesis]. 

After IIT Delhi, I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford.  I was supported by the KC Mahindra Scholarship, Tiara Special Grant and a Second Undergraduate Degree Scholarship by Harris Manchester College.


The [research section](/research)  gives a summary of my research projects.

I've worked at these places: Jugnoo, Aurora Energy Research, Opera Solutions, and Deloitte Consulting. <!-- The [work section](/work)  spells out my professional experience in greater detail.   -->
