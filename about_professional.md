Platonia ("Tinder for skills barter") will be on Google playstore by the end of this week. It has been my labour of love for the past one year, so do check it out when its launched and leave some feedback!


I study data structures and algorithms in my free time. This [github repository](https://github.com/piyushahuja/data-structures-and-algorithms) contains some useful implementations in Java. I try to add comments which give an intuition behind  an algorithm, so you might find it useful for learning purposes. 


I graduated from [IIT Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Delhi) with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master's thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg). Here's a [link to my thesis][thesis]. 

After IIT Delhi, I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford. The [research](/research) section gives a summary of my research projects.


I've worked at these places: [Jugnoo](https://www.jugnoo.in/), [Aurora Energy Research](https://www.auroraer.com/), [Opera Solutions](https://www.operasolutions.com/), and Deloitte Consulting. The [work](/work) section spells out my professional experience in greater detail.  Here's a link to my [resume][resumeFile].
