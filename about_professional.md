I enjoy solving algorthmic problems in my free time. This [github repository](https://github.com/piyushahuja/data-structures-and-algorithms) contains some implementations in Java.


I graduated from [IIT Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Delhi) with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master's thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg). Here's a [link to my thesis][thesis]. 

After IIT Delhi, I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford. The [research section](/research)  gives a summary of my research projects.


I've worked at these places: [Jugnoo](https://www.jugnoo.in/), [Aurora Energy Research](https://www.auroraer.com/), [Opera Solutions](https://www.operasolutions.com/), and Deloitte Consulting.
