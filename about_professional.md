*today.i.learnt* will be out on Google playstore by the end of this week. It has been my labour of love for the past one year, so do check it out when its launched and leave some feedback!


I study data structures and algorithms in my free time. This [github repository](https://github.com/piyushahuja/data-structures-and-algorithms) contains some implementations in Java. I add comments which give an intuition behind the algorithms, so you might find it useful for the purpose of learning. 


I graduated from [IIT Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Delhi) with a five-year Integrated Masters in Mathematics and Computing in 2013. My master's thesis was in the design of approximation algorithms under [Naveen Garg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naveen_Garg). Here's a [link to my thesis][thesis]. 

After IIT Delhi, I read for a second BA in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford. The [research section](/research)  gives a summary of my research projects.


I've worked at these places: [Jugnoo](https://www.jugnoo.in/), [Aurora Energy Research](https://www.auroraer.com/), [Opera Solutions](https://www.operasolutions.com/), and Deloitte Consulting. The [work section](/work)  spells out my professional experience in greater detail.  Here's a link to my [resume][resumeFile].
